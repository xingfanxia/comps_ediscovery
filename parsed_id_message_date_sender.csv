Anyway, let's see what happens with thevariance.  I appreciate your efforts.By the way, did you have any problems with any of the neighbors?Bob----- Original Message -----From: <Phillip.K.Allen@enron.com>To: <wise.counsel@lpl.com>Sent: Wednesday, November 14, 2001 8:19 AMSubject: RE: word file as promisedBob,I turned in the application for a variance yesterday.  The hearing will beon January 8th.  In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing,the application had to be in by November 9th.  I was under the impressionthat yesterday was the deadline.  Sorry if I dropped the ball.On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some usefulsuggestions about the addition.   It might be possible to move the additionforward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the newspace.  You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and usethe new space for your game/play/music room.  Then you could close off theexisting play room to replace the bedroom lost.  Part of the play room thatis bordered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could beused for a built in desk with a couple of computers.  This way you wouldnot have to add a second staircase.  The walls needed to convert theplayroom to a bedroom should be minor construction.  In the back you couldslope the roof until you were within the setback.  Then you could place alarge dormer facing the back of the property or bring a wall straight up.>From the driveway the addition would have the same elevation as yourdrawing but intwould be brought forward with a covered parking area belowthe addition.  The kitchen and dining room windows would still open to thedriveway but they would be more shaded.  That is the west side of the houseso that might not be a bad thing.  Your ideas about opening up the kitchento the living room or dining room would still be possible.  Personally, Ithink opening the dining room would be the better idea.I don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested inexploring anything except your original plan.  But I wanted to suggestsomething in case the variance was not granted.  Let me know if you want meto try and sketch out these ideas.Phillip      -----Original Message-----     From:   ""Robert W.

Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI     I am stuck on my last starter.  Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty  Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he  is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should  be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the  season.    Answer - GG     Alexander has been a revelation in his first two  starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to  him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not  be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and   Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who  may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker  will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not  destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a  great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score  a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a  Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems.  	  Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA     Should I start Rod Gardner or  Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is  looking better each week.    Answer - GG     Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains  instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be  geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The  Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of  the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is  quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants'  No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing  Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week.  Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with  Hilliard because of his experience and continuing  improvement.  	  Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO     I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB -  Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson?    Answer - GG     Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but  the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in  him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas  after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a  respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a  Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against  the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with  the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.  	    Tip of the Week      Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is  a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions  override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in  the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the  Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle.  And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be  surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.  	  This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

However, they are very interested in weather hedges to protect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable us to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a weather product.As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our opportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we implement our strategy in California.Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset management deal that we should approach?  Otherwise, we intend to systematically identify and work through all the candidates. Laird",allen-p

The land is selling for $2.50 per squarefoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in WestSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexesand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  Thisproperty will have the best location for student housing of all newprojects, just as the duplexes do now.If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as thereis a very, very short window of opportunity.

Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states ""Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan…"".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of ""a single sum distribution"" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.  This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns.  Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further.Phillip   -----Original Message-----From: 	Oxley, David  Sent:	Monday, November 26, 2001 8:31 AMTo:	Allen, Phillip K.Cc:	Whalley, Greg; Joyce, MarySubject:	Answer For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.        Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.",allen-p

Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very difficult.The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they will support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).  According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan. Key Points of the Bridge FinancingInitial Loan Amount:	$4.125 BLenders:		JP Morgan		$2.5 B			Lehman Brothers		$1.0 B			Bear Stearns		$625 MTax Exempt Portion:	Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exemptProjected Interest Rate:	Taxable Rate		5.77%			Tax-Exempt Rate		4.77%Current Projected Blended IR:		5.38%Maturity Date:		August 29, 2001For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earlier in the crisis. SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments.",allen-p

A single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows: 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.  2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and        October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different. I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me anytime I can assist you towards this goal.Sincerely,Phillip Allen",allen-p

After the treasury comes due     on Jan     31, 2002, you will have another $750,000.  You really don't have to     worry     about your margin requirements because you still get  80% of the value     of     your municipals credited  towards marginable securities.  So, the     bottom     line is 785m right now.  Jan 31, 2002 another 750m.  One thing to keep     in     mind are 28 put contracts you still have out there.

If the energy is needed by CORE wouldn't the deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and QF supply?  If the energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that recoup that amount over time.  Once again there would be a CTC type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered.

The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious).Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts.The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address ""the DWR contract problem"" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access.Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any ""out clauses"" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that ""outs"" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.)In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts.All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights.We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.Thanks,Jeff",allen-p

Regarding the utilities,  you and I know that I have had the right to shut off the utilities to a property I don't own for sometime now.  I did not do that because I wanted to stay on good terms with the Kuo's while negotiating the release.  I had the utilities taken out of my name yesterday.  The city of seguin informs me that the meters were read yesterday and the final bill will be mailed to me next week.  Then I can compute the amount that the Kuo's owe me for utilities and send them a check for the rock repairs.  Please let Pauline know that she needs to go down to the city and take care of the deposit by Friday or the power may be disconnected.  The utilities are already in her name.In my mind the utilities were never a bargaining chip.  Rather, you and I are paying the $11,000 in exchange for the release.  Regarding the transfer of ownership into a limited partnership, I will most likely be agreeable to this but I want to review all the loan documents with Jacques and ensure that there is still a personal guarantee on the two notes.  I expect to have that done by Friday.I would like for her to sign the release today, but if she won't sign until I consent to the limited partnership then the release will have to wait until Friday.  As far as the utilities go,  I made the transfer for two reasons: 1) I need to know the amount that I have paid to net against the $11,000 and 2) I had the right to take the utilities out of my name and I didn't want the balance to get out of hand.I will call you when I am comfortable consenting to the limited partnership.Phillip -----Original Message-----From: 	""Jeff Smith"" <jsmith@austintx.com>@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-+22Jeff+20Smith+22+20+3Cjsmith+40austintx+2Ecom+3E+40ENRON@ENRON.com] Sent:	Tuesday, June 12, 2001 3:25 PMTo:	Allen, Phillip K.Subject:	The StageI spoke with Pauline and she says she is ready to transfer the utilities.However, she wants to get your signed permission to transfer their ownershipinterests to the J&P Kuo, Ltd. for purposes of paying back the two notes.(per her attorneys advice).

In preparation for that meeting we would like to gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main contacts at SW Gas?We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly appreciated.Thanks,Laird",allen-p

The WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but there can be a siginificant difference between ""scheduled"" and ""actual"" generation.  You are pulling ""scheduled.""  If someone doesn't schedule their generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on the generation side.On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is better than the ""scheduled"" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal consumer then it is obviously a different story.Let's talk.",allen-p

In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.  This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.

We are hoping to  supplement EMF's list of economists and economic modelers who are  largely academics or with government labs or offices with folks from companies  who can help shed some light on how companies anticipate markets  will react to climate policies and the possible changes to prices and  availability of cleaner fuels such as natural gas.  A description of the  2-day program follows, and we can provide more information on the EMF meeting as  well if that's helpful.  I would be grateful if you can help identify  someone at Enron -- or otherwise -- who you feel could both contribute  to and benefit from the discussions with top economists and modelers.    If you need more information, please feel  free to call me or Leianne Clements (our economist) at the Pew Center number  listed below.   Thanks for considering,Vicki Arroyo CochranDirector of Policy Analysis   The Economics of Natural Gas in the Climate Change  Debate (August 9-10, 2001)Determining future demands and supply of natural gas (NG)  are important in determining climate policies since burning NG is relatively  ""cleaner"" than burning coal and oil.   A climate policy based on reducing the carbon content in fuels would  favor NG, along with other less-carbon intensive energy sources, thus  accelerating its demand.    However, economic models looking at the climate change issue show mixed  results on this issue; many models show the demand for NG increasing relative to  more ""dirty"" fuels while others show its demand decreasing at a rate faster than  oil (explained by NG demand being more responsive to a tax).  The Pew Center has found that NG information is often  extrapolated from that of oil.   Without clear information on the true path of the NG sector,  policy-makers will be misinformed on how to address the climate change  problem.  The Pew Center will host a  conference in conjunction with the Energy Modeling Forum of Stanford University,  to gather leading experts on both the modeling and practical side of determining  natural gas issues.  A report will  be published summarizing the topics discussed in the  conference.Pew Center on Global Climate Change  2101 Wilson Blvd. Suite 550 Arlington, VA 22201 Tel: (703) 516-4146 Fax: (703) 841-1422 www.pewclimate.org    - Chess.gif <Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>",allen-p

The bookcovers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily -interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 yearslearning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings,structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that havelasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and goodbackground information for sustainable builder folks.Thank you, Mr. Moore.

I am in a balancing act between moving on the construction and holding until the lien is perfected. I talked to Cheerie and she said the person in Dallas is trying to get it done today, however, she may not finish it out today, which means it will be sent for Thursday morning delivery to a sister Ticor office for signature and recording.  Have they told you any of this? Or do I need to make sure you know when, where, and how as soon as I know.I talked to Andrew this morning the Dallas office received the Appraisal and gave the information to us over the phone.  The appraised value as built is 12.5 million, the NOI is $1,152,695.  The problem is the Land Value is $1,120,000, as this is what they have recorded as the transaction cost in January.  Andrew talked to me about if we want to put additional costs on top of this showing improvements or other costs associated with the value to show an increase in value?.  I am tending to think we are going to reduce our overall loan by adjusting the Land, Title Policy Amount, Debt Carry Cost and some other small adjustments to costs. This would reduce our overall debt and resultant equity requirement. The main difference in committing to a greater loan is that our costs of points will rise and our equity may be out of balance in the end, vs. if we borrow the exact amount, we may risk being short and needing a loan increase for any soft cost overages. I have been working on this and I am reviewing the changes to see what overall effects each change will have on your equity and return.We are firm on the construction numbers given to you previously and we have had a number of additional costs which we have been able to absorb in the overall construction budget.  The biggest is the detention pond dredging which has gone up in cost.  The only area left to work through is the foundation/concrete number and I am confident we will hit that one on the mark. Thus, overall I am comfortable with the Hard Cost numbers at this point.I am attempting to get with Irwin and Cheerie and seeing if we can get the final Doc's put together. Have'nt been able to get a meeting yet.I just got interrupted in another meeting.  Let me know if there are any questions today.",allen-p

He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.

I will set up a room with Kim.Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS, TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the        parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and TAGG but the issues facing        scheduling in Unify are grey.2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the ""assume it is messed up"" policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need further      scrutiny.3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training courses, review progress and make cuts.5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at everything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add    some value and direction to the group.In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD to work part time to get it done.Phillip",allen-p

The first section is titled ""Introduction to Risk Management"" and the second section is ""Hedging Instruments/Risk Management Products"".  However, many of the bullet points in the first section are describing hedging instruments that belong in second section.  I would limit the introduction to types of risk, identifying risk, and examples when risks are not hedged.  Then the second section should contain all the details of hedging tools.  Definitions of derivatives and how they can be used to manage the risk in the first section would be in this section.  The third section would include the roles and accounting basics.

It would be paid off in 10years, you would reap some cash flow during that period, then the bonuskicks in after that with the 10 yr. renewals at a higher lease incomeafter it's paid off. It would probably go beyond another 10 years. Cashon cash returns don't mean as much on shorter amoritazations like Roma.We have shown this info and flyers to several people, so do let us knowif you are interested in any of them...I really don't think they willlast long. With best regards, Jim Wills - new analysis.xls << File: new analysis.xls >>",allen-p

It  represents a comprehensive improvement over its Jimmy predecessor, making  it one of the most competitive mid-sized SUVs on the market.   The fact that it is still ""truck-based"" - which essentially refers to the  full-frame construction that makes its Yukon big brother such a beefy  workhorse - does not mean that this SUV rides like a truck. Quite the  contrary, the Envoy is smooth and refined in a way that would have been  unthinkable just a few years ago. Of course, the market in which the Envoy  competes has become packed with excellent choices, with everyone from Acura  to Mercury entering the fray. We drove an Envoy SLE 4WD to find out how it  stacks up.

In attendance were Ken Lay, the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation based on the governor's comments:Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate analysts and other ""nonadvocates"" to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere ""brainstorming"".  Some of these ideas would require legislative action.State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a ""couple"" of generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This was a frequently recurring theme.Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus basis to consumers.Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in California.State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more widely deploy distributed generation.Expand in-state gas production.Take state lands gas royalties in kind.negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies.Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time.Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be able to help out here).Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators.Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's thoughts and get them to Kari)He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- not just the 5 one year strips.He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal.He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues.Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.",allen-p

Sent:	Friday, November 16, 2001 8:38 AMTo:	Whalley, Greg; Lavorato, JohnSubject:	FW: Greg,After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my deferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen regarding the Phantom Stock Account.  Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum distribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% penalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee receives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90% of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yields a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom Stock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. shares in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that in several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated that the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,  section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.""  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other sections of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do not apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distribution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one payment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for the Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states ""The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock"".  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Corp. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond section 6.3.The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of distribution under each of the three interpretations:Section 6.3		Plan Administrators		Section 7.1Number of shares		6,600	shares		6,600	shares			6,600 sharesRelative share price		$27.23							$83.13Phantom Stock Value		$179,718						$548,65810% Penalty			-17,972			 -600				-54,866Value to be distributed		$161,746		6,000 shares			$493,792Current stock price									$10Distribution			$161,746		6,000 shares			49,379 sharesI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout.   In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matter.Sincerely,Phillip Allen",allen-p

I spoke to your office and they thought it best that I address my questions to you directly.  Here is my situation.  I purchased a 32 acre tract in Leander about 8 months ago.  I have a contract to sell the property which should close around July 18th.  I expect to realize a gain of around $400,000.  See calculations below:Sales price:		2,100,000Purchase price		1,200,000Fees&Devel costs	  500,000Profit			 400,000The cash generated at the sale will be close to $1 million after repayment of a loan.I am interested in protecting this gain through a 1031 exchange.I am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that might qualify.  First, there is a 10 acre tract that was purchased by Bishops Corner, Ltd for $1.15 million six months ago.  I lent the partnership the cash to buy the land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily project.  We could not come to terms for the development, so the partnership was conveyed to me.  The loan still exist.  I am an 80% limited partner.  Another investor is the other limited partner.  We have set up a Corporation to be the general partner.  We intend to develop the property. Is there a creative way to use the land purchase in a 1031 exchange?Second,  I have a small tract in New Braunfels under contract for $400,000.  I am applying for FHA financing for a 180 unit apartment complex and hope to receive an invitation letter prior to closing.  I would need to place this property in a limited partnership eventually, but is there a way to buy the property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the IRS then move it to a LP.If neither of these deals qualify, I would still like to find another piece of property.  My two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding property in my own name.  Is there a way to insure during the 1st year then move a different entity?Thank you in advance for your help.Phillip Allen	8855 Merlin CtHouston, TX 77055pallen70@hotmail.comwk 713-853-7041hm 713-463-8626",allen-p

Here are my observations:  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year    Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising.    Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share. Current price 37 Nat. Gas 34 Crude  10 Total  81  Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?

Earnings.com - NewsEarnings.com 	[IMAGE] 		     NT   5.92 -0.03    Nortel Networks Reports Results for Third Quarter 2001   TORONTO, Oct 18, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Nortel Networks Corporation(b) (NYSE:NT)(TSE:NT.):         --  Revenues from continuing operations: US$3.7 billion     --  Pro forma net loss(a) per share: US$0.68; before incremental         charges: US$0.27     --  Net loss from continuing operations: US$3.5 billion     --  Positive operating cashflow contributes to increase in cash to         US$3.4 billion    Nortel Networks Corporation(b) (NYSE:NT)(TSE:NT.) today reported results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2001 prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles.   Revenues from continuing operations were US$3.69 billion for the third quarter of 2001 compared to US$6.73 billion in the same period in 2000. Pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for the third quarter of 2001, excluding incremental provisions and other charges, was US$854 million or US$0.27 per common share. Including the incremental provisions and other charges, pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for the third quarter of 2001 was US$2.18 billion, or US$0.68 per common share, compared to pro forma net earnings of US$597 million, or US$0.19 per common share on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2000.   In the quarter, incremental charges included in the pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) were comprised of: US$750 million (pre-tax) for excess and obsolete inventory, primarily related to Optical Inter-City; US$767 million (pre-tax) for increased provisions related to trade receivables and customer financing; and US$380 million (pre-tax) primarily related to charges associated with certain third party investments. The Company also recorded: a US$801 million (pre-tax) charge for restructuring associated with the completion of the workforce reductions and facilities closures announced in June 2001; and a US$223 million (pre-tax) charge primarily related to the approximately 50 percent reduction in manufacturing capacity of its Photonics Components business.   Including Acquisition Related Costs(a), stock option compensation from acquisitions and divestitures, and one-time gains and charges, Nortel Networks recorded a net loss from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2001 of US$3.47 billion or US$1.08 per common share.   ""Revenues for the quarter reflected the challenges presented as the telecom industry adjusted to new levels of spending,"" said John Roth, president and chief executive officer Nortel Networks. ""Our bottom line results reflected the impact of actions we have taken to adjust to the new business levels. During the third quarter of 2001, Nortel Networks continued to aggressively implement its work plan to reduce its cost structure and streamline operations. The Company is in the final stages of implementing a cost structure to drive break even at a quarterly revenue level well below US$4 billion. The structure is expected to be in place in the first quarter of 2002.""   Frank Dunn, the Company's new president and chief executive officer effective November 1, 2001, said, ""Nortel Networks is focusing its investments and its organization to drive continued leadership across three businesses: Metro Networks, which encompasses metro optical networking, IP networking, IP services and voice over IP solutions for service providers and enterprises; Wireless Networks; and Optical Long Haul Networks. In the quarter, our product programs continued to advance as we focused on building on our industry-leading portfolio of solutions. We also continued to work with our customers to help them plan and deploy the solutions that will position them to drive reductions in their cost of operations and enable them to take advantage of opportunities for new revenue streams. Some key milestones over the past 120 days included:         --  the First North American ILEC began the circuit to packet         transition with the deployment of our carrier-grade         softswitch;     --  Announced Metro DWDM wins in the United States, Europe and         Japan;     --  Announced Multiservice backbone awards (ATM, IP, MPLS) in         China, Germany and Asia;     --  Continued progress on 3G Wireless Internet infrastructure         deployments and completed the first commercial UMTS test calls         and the first CDMA2000 1X mobile IP call;     --  Introduced advances in IP solutions, including an integrated         Layer 4-7 content switching capability on our Layer 2-3 Edge         Switch Router; and     --  Completed hardware design, significantly advanced software         integration and began production of OPTera Connect HDX         solution.""    As announced on October 2, 2001, the Company expects to have an overall workforce of approximately 45,000 after the completion of its work plan. Notifications to employees impacted by workforce reductions are expected to be substantially completed by the end of October 2001. A workforce reduction and related charge will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. Over the next few quarters, the Company also expects to continue to divest non-core businesses in accordance with its work plan. The number of positions which will be impacted by this divesture activity (including the impact of divestures announced or completed to date) is expected to ultimately approach 10,000 positions.   Commenting on cash management in the quarter, Frank Dunn said, ""We are extremely pleased with the results that have been generated from our focus on cash management, which drove a significant improvement in cash and contributed to positive cashflow from operations. In addition, the Company further increased its financial flexibility by completing a highly successful US$1.8 billion convertible debt issue which, combined with positive operating cash performance from continuing operations and a significant reduction in short term debt, has significantly enhanced our strong liquidity position. Given the industry correction and actions we have taken over the last two quarters, Nortel Networks balance sheet is well positioned.""   ""While we believe we are beginning to see early indications that capital spending by service providers is approaching sustainable levels, it still remains difficult to predict. In light of this and the uncertainty regarding the potential impacts of events taking place in the wake of the September 11, 2001 tragedies and their effect on economies and businesses around the world, we are not providing guidance for the fourth quarter of 2001 or the full year 2002 at this time,"" concluded Dunn.         Revenue Breakdown from Continuing Operations    Network Infrastructure revenues decreased 48 percent in the third quarter of 2001 compared to the third quarter of 2000. Wireless Internet solutions grew substantially in Canada and slightly in Asia, which was more than offset by a considerable decline in Latin America, a slight decline in the United States and a decline in Europe. Optical Inter-city revenues were down sharply in the United States, Europe and Latin America, minimally offset by growth in Asia. Local Internet revenues were down substantially in the United States, Europe, Canada and Latin America, which were minimally offset by an increase in Asia.   Photonic Components segment revenues were down 93 percent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. The sharp decline in the segment was largely due to considerably lower sales of Nortel Networks Optical Inter-city solutions compared to the third quarter of 2000.   Other revenues declined 29 percent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Substantial growth in Global Professional Services in Europe and Asia, and strong growth in the United States, was more than offset by considerable declines in legacy voice solutions for corporations across all regions and wireless OEM revenues in most regions.   Commensurate with its announcement on October 2, 2001 to align its resources around three businesses (Metro Networks, Wireless Networks and Optical Long Haul Networks), Nortel Networks will evolve its financial reporting to reflect the new organization beginning in the fourth quarter of 2001.   Geographic revenues for the third quarter of 2001 compared to the same period in 2000 decreased 54 percent in the United States, 53 percent in Canada and 30 percent outside the United States and Canada.         Nine-Month Results    For the first nine months of 2001, revenues from continuing operations were US$14.06 billion compared to US$19.75 billion for the same period in 2000. Pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for the first nine months of 2001 was US$4.01 billion, or US$1.26 per common share, compared to pro forma net earnings of US$1.57 billion, or US$0.51 per common share on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2000. Including the net loss from discontinued access solutions operations, Acquisition Related Costs(a), stock option compensation from acquisitions and divestitures, one-time gains and charges, and the write down of intangible assets, Nortel Networks recorded a net loss of US$25.48 billion, or US$8.01 per common share, for the first nine months of 2001.         Spending Management    The Company continued to make rapid progress to reduce its cost structure. Compared to the Company's year-end 2000 cost structure, exclusive of incremental provisions and charges, the Company's cost structure at the end of the third quarter of 2001 is lower by approximately US$1 billion.         Gross Margin    Gross margin for the third quarter of 2001 was approximately 1 percent reflecting incremental charges of approximately US$750 million related to excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the expected decrease in sales due to the continued downturn in the market. Excluding the impact of these incremental and other contract-related charges, gross margin for the third quarter of 2001 was approximately 25 percent, compared to approximately 26 percent in the second quarter of 2001.         Expenses    Selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses in the third quarter of 2001 were US$1.92 billion. The continued impact of the market adjustments and further decline in some of our of customers' financial condition resulted in incremental provisions of US$767 million in the quarter related to customer receivables and financings. Excluding the incremental provisions in both periods, SGÀexpenses in the third quarter of 2001, compared to second quarter of 2001, were down by approximately US$190 million.   Research and development (""R&D"") expenses were US$808 million in the third quarter of 2001. The R?expenses in the quarter reflected focused investments to drive continued market leadership in our core businesses and the elimination of spending in all other areas. Compared to the second quarter of 2001, R? expenses in the third quarter of 2001 were down by approximately US$100 million, reflecting the impact of restructuring and streamlining operations.   The financial results of Nortel Networks Limited(b) (""NNL""), Nortel Networks Corporation's principal operating subsidiary, are fully consolidated into Nortel Networks results. NNL has preferred shares which are publicly traded in Canada. For the third quarter of 2001, NNL took a restructuring charge of US$793 million (pre-tax) associated with the completion of workforce reductions and the closure of certain facilities related to business streamlining; and recorded US$207 million (pre-tax) primarily related to the approximately 50 percent reduction in manufacturing capacity of the Photonics Components business. All such amounts are included in the consolidated Nortel Networks amounts described above.

Nortel Networks disclaims any intention or obligation to         update or revise these preliminary results prior to the filing         of its reported results for the three months ended September         30, 2001.     (2) Reported results for the nine months ended September 30, 2001         and 2000 are net of applicable income tax recoveries of $723         and $46, respectively.     (3) Impact of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting         Standards (""SFAS"") No. 133, ""Accounting for Derivative         Instruments and Hedging Activities"", and the corresponding         amendments under SFAS No. 138, ""Accounting for Certain         Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities"" (""SFAS         133""). The adoption of SFAS 133 did not affect either basic or         diluted earnings (loss) per common share after giving effect         to the accounting change.     (4) As a result of the reported net losses for the nine months         ended September 30, 2001 and 2000, and the pro forma net loss         for the nine months ended September 30, 2001, approximately         71, 162, and 71, respectively, of potentially dilutive         securities (in millions) have not been included in the         calculation of diluted loss per common share for the periods         presented because to do so would have been anti-dilutive.

The loss from         discontinued operations was $3,733 pre-tax ($3,010 afelatedx).         Acquisition Related Costs of $4,433 pre-tax ($4,164 after-tax)         were primarily associated with the acquisitions of Bay         Networks, Inc., Alteon WebSystems, Inc., Xros, Inc., Qtera         Corporation, Clarify Inc., and the 980 nanometer pump-laser         chip business. Stock option compensation from acquisitions and         divestitures was $91. Cumulative effect of accounting change         was a $24 pre-tax ($15 after-tax) gain. One-time gains were         $45 pre-tax ($21 after-tax) and one-time charges were $15,054         pre-tax ($14,241 after-tax), primarily related to the write         down of intangible assets of $12,486 pre-tax ($12,400         after-tax) and restructuring costs of $2,463 pre-tax ($1,748         after-tax).

(Reminder) Update GIS InformationThis is a reminder !!!  If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS information, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com on the command line of your browser.The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.  Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.   Thanks,Dave",allen-p

The other two are new.The Roma is like buying a savings account. It would be paid off in 10years, you would reap some cash flow during that period, then the bonuskicks in after that with the 10 yr. renewals at a higher lease incomeafter it's paid off. It would probably go beyond another 10 years. Cashon cash returns don't mean as much on shorter amoritazations like Roma.We have shown this info and flyers to several people, so do let us knowif you are interested in any of them...I really don't think they willlast long.

The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.As you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments.  If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.

Below is a list of questions on the specs:1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less and cost about the same?2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory joist?3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What type of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or Cellulose?5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know the difference between an apron and a stool.7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron railings?15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except for change orders?I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but this is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to call Cary Kipp tosee about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.PhillipI",allen-p

I can explain why I would have interest in this vs. ourconversation Monday about no exclusive. What are your thoughts? Because ofall that is going on this may be the best route if you want it sold ASAPlike you are saying.Kipp, Flores @ about 5:00 today agreed to a $600.00 reduction which isbullshit. So I have two options to get the lien released. 1) is to pay themoff less the $600.00 and do a mutual release of each party 2) is to pay themin full without the $600.00 reduction under protest, with an agreement torelease the lien immediately. Option 2 allows us to go back at some time ifwe feel it prudent and sue them for the full $12,000 over because we paid itunder protest. I like option 2 because it pays in full and I would ratherpay in protest rather then take a small reduction and agree to something Idon't agree with. Let me know what you think via e-mail.  I wil need thecheck for the full amount sent to me payable to Kipp Flores, and I willhandle the protest and the release of lien immediately.As far as Grande goes I need to talk to Michelle.

Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states ""Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan…"".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of ""a single sum distribution"" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.  This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns.  Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further.Phillip   -----Original Message-----From: 	Oxley, David  Sent:	Monday, November 26, 2001 8:31 AMTo:	Allen, Phillip K.Cc:	Whalley, Greg; Joyce, MarySubject:	Answer For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.        Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.",allen-p

He is short the summer due to the prospect of another 200,000+/day of supply coming back by July 1st.  See attached spreadsheet.  In order to displace Aeco gas coming down to Kingsgate his target for Sumas value is AECO -0.10.  But since his forecast for Aeco is that they will have 30 BCF left in storage at the end of March and current cash is trading down 0.70 or wider versus a rest of summer curve around down 0.50, he is expecting the AECO curve to widen to down 0.85.  Therefore, his ultimate target for Sumas is down 0.95 versus the current market of down 0.40	His winter Sumas shorts are based on his analysis of total supply capacity versus peak demand. See attached spreadsheet.  Sumas still commands the premium of an isolated market during the winter but the supply numbers don't  support that premium.	In conclusion, I think I will sell some more summer sumas for my book. 2.  I will stay after the meeting to talk about Mike G's issues.",allen-p

It appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows: 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.  2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and        October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that are dramatically different. I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me anytime I can assist you towards this goal.Sincerely,Phillip Allen",allen-p

I have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year.  The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for power quality reasons.The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due to server farms and technology companies.  There is a 100 MW server farm trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months due to distribution infrastructure issues.  Obviously, Seattle, Porltand, Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude awakening in the next 2-3 years.---------------------- Forwarded by Kevin M Presto/HOU/ECT on 09/05/2000 03:41 PM ---------------------------   	Enron North America Corp.

The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and computer servers for the                  region's growing number of dot-coms.                        Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up construction                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than a mile from its                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several fiber optic backbones, the                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and eventually                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, Microsoft and Onvia.com.                        Exodus is not the only company building massive data centers near Seattle.                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, Globix and                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house the networking                  equipment of the Internet economy.                        It is a big business that could have an effect on everything from your                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access your favorite Web sites.                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and server farms, are                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent Valley that some                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and Puget Sound                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, high-security                  facilities.                        ""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting 445                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,"" said Karl                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound Energy. ""That is                  the equivalent of six oil refineries.""                        A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, the rise of the Internet                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads.                        Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington Utilities and                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers. The                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing residential and business                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 million each,                  Karzmar said.                        Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to bring up the data center                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.                        For the utilities that provide power to homes, businesses and schools in the                  region, this is a new and complex issue.                        On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing appetite for power --                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The facilities run 24 hours a                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a constant revenue                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that they could                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital expenditures.                        Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates                  in the area is still open to debate.                        ""These facilities are what we call extremely dense loads,"" said Bob Royer,                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle City Light.                        ""The entire University of Washington, from stadium lights at the football                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. We have data                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 and 50 megawatts.""                        With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate complex in Tukwila is                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased the 1.35 million                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from Boeing Space &                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 92 percent of the                  six-building complex to seven different co-location companies.                        ""It is probably the largest data center park in the country,"" boasts Laurent                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG Communications,                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama Networks all                  lease space in the office park.                        After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, Sabey has become an                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under management or                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole claims his firm is                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in the country.                        As more people access the Internet and conduct bandwidth-heavy tasks                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for co-location space in                  Seattle continues to escalate.                        But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center space is growing at a                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, causing similar                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and California.                        Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location space, plans to nearly                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. While companies                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many high-tech companies                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such as Exodus that                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic management.                        ""We have 2 million square feet of space under construction and we plan to                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more demand right now                  than data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an account executive at Exodus in                  Seattle.                        The booming market for co-location space has left some in the local utility                  industry perplexed.                        ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do to serve the growth,""                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is almost stunned by this, in                  a way.""",allen-p

As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner.I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realizethe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks asif she will be ok in the long run.George W.

Crocker"" <clclegal2@aol.com> Subject: Investment StructureSTRUCTURE:Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presumeKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make everyeffort to be accommodating.CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURESCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not asformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORSYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I canprovide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Callwhen you have reviewed and we can discuss further.Sincerely,George RichardsPresident, Creekside Builders, LLC - winmail.dat",allen-p

Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states ""Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan…"".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of ""a single sum distribution"" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.  This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns.  Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further.Phillip   -----Original Message-----From: 	Oxley, David  Sent:	Monday, November 26, 2001 8:31 AMTo:	Allen, Phillip K.Cc:	Whalley, Greg; Joyce, MarySubject:	Answer For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.        Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.",allen-p

Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close.  I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  I don't know if this would be agreeable to you.  Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think.  If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections.  I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.We are torn between two good locations.  However, we are leaning towards Kerrville.  The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially.  We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San Marcos.  I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately.Phillip Allen713-463-8626pallen70@hotmail.com",allen-p

In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing, the application had to be in by November 9th.  I was under the impression that yesterday was the deadline.  Sorry if I dropped the ball.  On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some useful suggestions about the addition.   It might be possible to move the addition forward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the new space.  You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and use the new space for your game/play/music room.  Then you could close off the existing play room to replace the bedroom lost.  Part of the play room that is bordered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could be used for a built in desk with a couple of computers.  This way you would not have to add a second staircase.  The walls needed to convert the playroom to a bedroom should be minor construction.  In the back you could slope the roof until you were within the setback.  Then you could place a large dormer facing the back of the property or bring a wall straight up.  From the driveway the addition would have the same elevation as your drawing but intwould be brought forward with a covered parking area below the addition.  The kitchen and dining room windows would still open to the driveway but they would be more shaded.  That is the west side of the house so that might not be a bad thing.  Your ideas about opening up the kitchen to the living room or dining room would still be possible.

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as compared with the previous year.Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC (U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I hope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any questions or need any further information.",allen-p

Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA     Which two receivers should I start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Terry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins?    Answer - GG     As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start against a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards and three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have to go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To answer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carolina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at best, so our hands are tied.  	  Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL     I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye this week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weinke. What do you recommend?    Answer - GG     Miller has been very inconsistent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a big game.  	  Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE     Who should I start this week: Shannon Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin Johnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still available.    Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target in the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sharpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we highly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after another No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fantasy player.  	    Tip of the Week      Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive option the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk after five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes will continue to be a productive player all season.   	  This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact.  In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost.  (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one.  Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting.  Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions.  I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses.One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow.

Just login at  tdwaterhouse.com , click on 'News & Research', and then  on 'Goldman Sachs'.  Gradual  Uptrend Anticipated By Arnie Kaufman, Editor, The Outlook   We see further  but slower market progress.  Tired  after their recent run, stocks nevertheless are being supported  by signs that the economy is stabilizing, better news from Afghanistan  and a large pool of cash reserves earning meager returns. The  two-steps-forward, one-step-backward recovery since September  21 hasn't created the enthusiasm that would necessitate an early,  nasty correction. Investors, keeping in mind that every rally  of the past 19 months has ultimately failed, are regaining their  confidence only slowly.  Background  conditions don't lend themselves to a strong advance in the near  term. While recent data suggest that the recession will be mild  and will end early next year, risks to this forecast are high.  Another terrorist attack could deepen consumer gloom. The possibility  of the disruption of oil supplies still exists. The fiscal stimulus  package continues to be bogged down in partisan bickering.   Treasury  bond yields, moreover, have turned sharply higher, spurred by  the less dire economic reports and by chart breakouts. Yields  have quickly retraced the September-October decline.  S&P  technical analyst Mark Arbeter is impressed by the recent stock  market action and anticipates higher levels over the intermediate  term, but he believes the easiest and quickest gains are behind.  Arbeter sees a likely substantial amount of stock for sale when  Nasdaq (currently at 1898) moves into the 1920 to 2300 range and  the S&P 500 (now at 1139) reaches 1170 to 1300. He expects  it will take time to chew through this supply.  History  also suggests limited near-term upside potential. Three months  after the low points of the nine postwar bear markets, the S&P  500 was up an average of 14.9%. The index is already up 18% since  the September 21 low. Six months after the nine postwar bear market  lows, however, the ""500"" showed an average gain of 24.4%;  12 months after the lows, the index was ahead 34.5%, on average.

I still have the concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our project are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my concerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 million.  The components are as follows: Unit Cost, Site work, & builders profit($52/sf)   $7.6 million Land      1.15 Interim Financing     .85 Common Areas       .80 Total     $10.4Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.  Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.  Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.   We would like to have a conference call tomorrow to discuss alternatives.Phillip",allen-p

Note that theconstruction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than ourstandard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratioof 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costsare high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we haveactual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psfwithout overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairlysure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3bedroom.

As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.

I look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner.I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realizethe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks asif she will be ok in the long run.George W.

So that reduces some of the savings.  Either way it still appears that a panel home will cost close to $20,000 more for a 4000 sq ft home.  Even if I assume my energy savings will be $125/month, it would take approximately 22 years to recover the upfront cost assuming a 5% interest rate.  Cost is a major concern, but I am also concerned with the comfort level of the upstairs.  I am under the impression that the panels will prevent the upstairs from feeling significantly hotter than the downstairs as most two story homes do.  What are some other alternatives that would also be effective?  Radiant barrier?  More attic ventilation?

I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. Yousay that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. Ijust did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel costwas about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and wecan discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90per sq. ft.  excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of thetrue custom home level but should be achievable with good management.Richard MorganManager, Green Building ProgramAustin Energy721 Barton Springs Rd.Austin, TX 78704-1194Ph. 512.505.3709Fax 512.505.3711e-mail richard.morgan@austinenergy.com-----Original Message-----From: Allen, Phillip K.

I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I candecide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprintscompleted.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with8.5"" roof panels and use a metal roof.I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio thatis also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of$85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay withinthat budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick builthouse.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of aradiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the sameenergy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke toa sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additionalcosts for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would helpme construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid fromWink with Premier based on you reference.Thank you for your help.Phillip Allenpallen@enron.com713-853-7041**********************************************************************This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate andmay contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of theintended recipient (s).

What is going on?#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with email and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff know that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the property.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.  Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right now.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wade continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the property's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better and better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.  Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  It is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running an errand for the property.I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this time.

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:Price caps are almost never the right answerPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagesCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptableEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the WestThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.

It was  introduced back in 1983 as a boxy hatchback and sedan that quickly became  known for its eminent practicality and bulletproof reliability. Subsequent  generations became larger and more powerful, with the Camry line expanding  to include a wagon and a coupe. Toyota designed it to appeal to as many  buyers as possible, and buyers responded by making the Camry one of  America's best-selling vehicles.   For 2002, the Camry has been completely redesigned on a brand-new platform.  The new generation is being sold solely as a four-door sedan, although last  year's Camry Solara continues as a coupe and convertible. Toyota claims  that the new Camry's design is both sportier and more personal than the  sedans that came before. We evaluated a Camry XLE to find out if Toyota hit  its mark.

While we anticipate many new Analysts joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning (9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  In addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer.   Thanks in advance for your cooperation.  Thank you,Jana",allen-p

One for $150 and the other for $75.  Which apartments?  20a or #13? Utility overages for #26 and #44?  Where did you get these amounts?  For what periods? What is going on with #42.   Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!  That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money and time remodeling.  I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like leaky pipes.  If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor.  Then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.  This tenant has been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank.  Is this right?  Has the deposit been made yet? A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly.Phillip",allen-p

Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.Thank you.˜Sincerely,[IMAGE]˜˜˜George W.

We pretty much make whatever you would like to the specifications that you prefer. All of our buildings are durable and solidly constructed.  We build them in our shop and the ownner is rersponsible for their delivery.  There is no labor cost so you are only charged for the materials.Our most popular size and style is the 8' x 12' barn . This is the most economical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a given site. This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar style grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. We have usually build them with a 3'-10 1/2"" wide door opening.  I would think that would be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your dad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold over 30 of these in the past ten years. The price on this shed usually varies between $800 and $900.Your dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is a bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive.  It has vinyl siding and aluminum soffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe Pronschinske.  This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize and legally you are  to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it.   Your dad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though.The picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door.  We are presently building a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up door.  The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be roughly $1500.We will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your needs.  With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the easiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday October 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to finish that one on time.If you have any questions just e-mail me or call:	Whitehall School Disctrict 715-538-4364	My Home number 715-985-3063.Have a good one and take with you later.Sincerely,Mel Nelson",allen-p

With regards to the exercising of renewal options, you might be interested to know that the USPS actually renews these 94% of the time; some post offices are in the 75 years and above range on leases. And finally, the construction  costs are reflective of the construction codes and practices the USPS requires for contractors. These are well-built facilities, last a long time, and can be converted to many other uses if the post office moves out.I have added another post office for your consideration. It's in McAllen, is a multi-tenant building, and has a fairly strong cap rate. The flyer is attached.In any case, I would be glad to help you look for other investment possibilities over here.

Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact.  In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost.  (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one.  Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting.  Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions.  I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses.One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow.  Is BRM ""core"" to the Enron for next few months or new organization?

If you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.As far as recommendations, here is a short list: 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future       replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.                    This creates a shortage in later months. 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.                        Specific questions should include:    1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order to fill storage?  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too much gas from Socal's system.         I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less. 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major                     LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market and the      consumer has benefitted.

Automobile advertising is the largest category in domestic consumer media spending and accounts for about 17%, or $15 billion, the stock studiers say, using data from Competitive Media Reporting. By early fall, the analysts expect the car companies ""to ramp spending back up to support new model introductions and to regain market share from the imports.""

I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprints completed.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with 8.5"" roof panels and use a metal roof.I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.  That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels.

We should be able to work with this.Phillip -----Original Message-----From: 	mery.l.brown@accenture.com@ENRON  Sent:	Monday, November 05, 2001 5:11 PMTo:	pallen@enron.comCc:	donald.l.barnhart@accenture.com; kmcdani@enron.comSubject:	Interface Design UpdatePhillip,The purpose of this e-mail is to explain the results of our discussionswith the technical team after our meeting with you. We need to get yourapproval of the points listed below so that we can begin building theapplication.We can have the Position and P&L Reports show the results of the learner'sdecisions in previous periods, which will allow the learner move forward intime with wrong answers. This will achieve our goal of giving the learners""more rope"" and letting them see the results of their mistakes. In order toachieve this, we will have the following constraints:   The feedback will be fairly high-level, as we discussed in Thursday's   meeting. We will be able to provide feedback on cumulative P&L and   positions, but not about specific actions the learner took in a previous   period. We will not, for example, be able to say things like ""In   November, when we were headed into a cold winter, you chose to withdraw   gas. What you should have done was...""   We cannot save the P&L and position numbers. This means that if the   learner leaves the simulation, returns to the main menu, or experiences   a computer crash, his decisions will not be saved and he will need to   start over at time period one.   We cannot have the learner calculate P&L on storage costs,   transportation costs, or hedging instruments. This is because the right   answer and the available answer choices would have to depend on the   decisions the learner has made. Now that the learner can go down any   path he chooses, the number of possible answers is extremely large, and   the right answers are variable. I believe these tasks will be actually   better if we don't have the learner calculate P&L because he has already   calculated P&L numerous times in the structurer/customer scenarios and   conversion and arbitrage scenarios. Furthermore, the type of feedback we   would have to give about specific P&L numbers will not flow well with   the high-level, global-type feedback we are now planning to give in this   task.We cannot export price numbers into Excel because the Indeliq frameworkdoes not support the downloading of data into external applications. Thetechnical effort required to add this functionality far exceeds our currentdevelopment budget. We can, however, do some calculations for the learneron the screen. We can also try to somehow allow the learner to make themistake of using future prices instead of discounted prices.If you could please respond with your approval or concerns by end of dayWednesday, it will allow us to move forward with the development of thissimulation. I would be happy to discuss these points with you; please letme know if you would like to set up a meeting.Thank you.MeryThis message is for the designated recipient only and may containprivileged or confidential information.

Now that we have had several traders managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu (Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those who are managing the books believe in the model's results.

Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and repairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on repairs.2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite manager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite.3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.Sales Price  705,0001st Lien   473,5002nd Lien  225,000Transfer fee    7,500Cash required   14,500NOI   100,0001st Lien    47,2922nd Lien   23,694Cash flow  29,014Cash on cash  200%These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then cash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect the additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years for a higher price.Do you want to reconsider?  Let me know.Phillip",allen-p

Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close.  I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  I don't know if this would be agreeable to you.  Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think.  If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections.  I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.We are torn between two good locations.  However, we are leaning towards Kerrville.  The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially.  We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San Marcos.

The binding open season, which began July 5, 2001 and closes on August 2, 2001, is in response to the interest expressed during El Paso's non-binding open season in March 2001 soliciting shippers for potential system expansions.The expansion capacity will be made available by adding compression to El Paso's Line 2000 from McCamey, Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, Arizona. The expansion capacity will be sold at El Paso's existing maximum California tariff rate, and the fuel charge is estimated to be 5 percent. The projected in-service date of the expansion facilities is mid-2003 subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory, environmental, and right-of-way authorizations.The receipt points on El Paso's system for this capacity will be the Waha and Keystone pools in the Permian Basin area of West Texas. The delivery points will be Southern California Gas Company (SoCal) and PG&E's proposed North Baja Pipeline, El Paso's bi-directional lateral (Line 1903), any future incremental capacity on the SoCal system from Ehrenberg, Arizona into the State of California, and any upstream points on El Paso's south mainline system where capacity exists.``This system expansion will add incremental interstate capacity to California, Arizona, New Mexico, and West Texas to meet increasing natural gas demands including the demand for natural gas to generate electricity for the western United States,'' said Patricia A. Shelton, president of El Paso Natural Gas Company.Interested parties can contact their transportation marketing representative or Mr. Jerry W. Strange at (719) 520-4687.El Paso Corporation is committed to meeting energy needs throughout North America and the world with operations that span the energy value chain from wellhead to electron. The company is focused on speeding the development of new technologies, such as clean coal and liquefied natural gas, to address critical energy shortages across the globe.

Here are the main points from their conversation1.	Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go BankruptCorroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that ""he was surprised they hadn't already.""  He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that ""they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent"" and that ""their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it.""He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the ""Plan B's"" are ""speculative"" at best.  He also thought that SoCal was being ""naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court.""2.	Bond Issuance- $12B Not EnoughAngelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B.   The only reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that ""$12B was all the market could handle.""  The current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State Comptroller's Kathleen Connell's office.3.	New Generator ConstructionAnglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority (authorized by the legislature last week) will ""build plants and not stop until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand.  Angelides expects the state to be ""5-10% short on power all summer.""",allen-p

I have been planning to be on vacation on August 1st -August 3rd and we are driving this afternoon before the kids get too cranky.I went over the analysis with Vladi.  It still seems that the bias of the weather products towards an above normal winter and the averaging vs event nature of the weather options keep them from being an effective hedge for Z6.See you on Monday.Phillip",allen-p

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and I'll take care of it..On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of $235,019.   (If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal #'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988) Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to GDP-Kingsgate. Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in case there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.

However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME's today. One concern is the firing of the learner who performs  bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature).SheriWhen you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a ""Dateline"" type theme for one, and a ""60 Minute"" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme. In the last two scenarios can we include a promotion out of the associate program for the stellar performers (i.e. title change to manager)?

Crocker"" <clclegal2@aol.com> Subject: Investment StructureSTRUCTURE:Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presumeKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make everyeffort to be accommodating.CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURESCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not asformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORSYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I canprovide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Callwhen you have reviewed and we can discuss further.Sincerely,George RichardsPresident, Creekside Builders, LLC - winmail.dat",allen-p

I was going for a simple farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.  A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:There will be a double porch across the back just like the frontNo dormers (Metal roof)1/2 bath under stairsOverall dimensions are 55 by 40What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.    Reagan suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the leftside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.  That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front porch would be smaller.I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder.I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned my alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan allowed.Phillip Allen713-853-7041---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 03/29/2001 09:10 AM ---------------------------Hunter S Shively03/26/2001 10:01 AMTo: phillip.k.allen@enron.comcc:  Subject:",allen-p

We pretty much make whatever you would like to the specifications that you prefer. All of our buildings are durable and solidly constructed.  We build them in our shop and the ownner is rersponsible for their delivery.  There is no labor cost so you are only charged for the materials.Our most popular size and style is the 8' x 12' barn . This is the most economical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a given site. This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar style grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. We have usually build them with a 3'-10 1/2"" wide door opening.  I would think that would be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your dad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold over 30 of these in the past ten years. The price on this shed usually varies between $800 and $900.Your dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is a bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive.  It has vinyl siding and aluminum soffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe Pronschinske.  This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize and legally you are  to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it.   Your dad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though.The picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door.  We are presently building a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up door.  The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be roughly $1500.We will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your needs.  With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the easiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday October 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to finish that one on time.If you have any questions just e-mail me or call:	Whitehall School Disctrict 715-538-4364	My Home number 715-985-3063.Have a good one and take with you later.Sincerely,Mel Nelson",allen-p

Masses believe US got what it deserves, but leaders have to condemn attacks to maintain relations with Washington.  Moderate Arab leaders are concerned that support for attacks at home -- and possible US reactions to strike -- will increase instability and could lead to major upheaval in their countries.  Saudi sources expect ""state of confusion"" to exist for immediate period ahead.In the West, no intelligence or law enforcement agency has anything concrete yet. Everything is therefore speculation, albeit logical speculation. Most importantly, the sophistication means someone bigger than bin Laden was involved, even if he was the final perpetrator. Oil PoliticsOPEC's Rodriguez has reassured oil markets on supplies, but no high-level Saudi officials have officially echoed this sentiment (nothing from Oil Minister Naimi).  Unofficially, we have reports that Saudi officials reporting that the terrorist incident ""relieves pressure on us to make anti-US moves"" in oil policy.",allen-p

I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I candecide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprintscompleted.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with8.5"" roof panels and use a metal roof.I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio thatis also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of$85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay withinthat budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick builthouse.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of aradiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the sameenergy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke toa sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additionalcosts for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would helpme construct the best home for the money.

Her records show basically no other income ($75/month), so I subtracted $3,000 from your number.  The expenses just need to reflect $20,000 more property taxes and the numbers should be right on.  $484 less $244 would be $240 of NOI.  I spoke to Jim Murnane this afternoon.

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.Richard  ---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT on 10/06/2000 08:34 AM ---------------------------Allan Severude10/05/2000 06:03 PMTo: Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Peggy Alix/HOU/ECT@ECT, Russ Severson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Mills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kenny Ha/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do listFrom our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated positions, I think we still have the following issues:We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation.Things left to do:I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope.For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all drill downs.Use the above to formulate a project plan.Things requested thus far (no particular order):Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal ticker.Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that add up existing position manager rows/columns).New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, transport, swaps, options, ...Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values of all curves on which the desk has a position.Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the appropriate positions to show for each:Gas Daily for monthly index,Physical gas for Nymex,Physical gas for Inside Ferc,Physical gas for Mid market.Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of using official valuations.Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility skew and correlations.Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid.Valuation of Gas Daily options.A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position manager.Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.Benchmark positions in TDS.Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit and explicit position break out issues.-- Allan.PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that point.",allen-p

Here are a few things that stood out on my first pass. Aluminum eaves/facia/soffit?  I thought we made this change.Roof- $15,500.  Seems $3,000 too high.  I think the old number for composition was $5,000 with the upgrade to SS of $6,900 for a total of $11,900.  Both the price per square and the numbers of squares seem too high.  I called a roofing company in Kerrville and got a ballpark number of $220-$300/square.  I wouldn't expect this house to be above the middle of the range.  Just on a back of the envelope calculation it seems like the roof area would be closer to 40 squares.

Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact.  In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost.  (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one.  Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting.  Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions.  I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses.One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow.  Is BRM ""core"" to the Enron for next few months or new organization?

We will participate in the development of a successor plan, and attempt to improve it if we can.  		SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval. Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.Infrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to improve infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals.

As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner.I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realizethe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks asif she will be ok in the long run.George W.

Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing but invoices were not being submitted.Let me know if you can draft these agreements.

Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very difficult.The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they will support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).  According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan. Key Points of the Bridge FinancingInitial Loan Amount: $4.125 BLenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B   Bear Stearns  $625 MTax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exemptProjected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%Current Projected Blended IR:  5.38%Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earlier in the crisis. SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments.",allen-p

Crocker"" <clclegal2@aol.com> Subject: Investment StructureSTRUCTURE:Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, ""Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?""  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presumeKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make everyeffort to be accommodating.CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURESCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not asformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORSYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I canprovide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.

Diluted earnings per share were $.22, down 59 percent from a year ago. Net revenues on a managed basis totaled $5.5 billion, down one percent from $5.6 billion a year ago. The company's return on equity was 14.2 percent.   Results for the third quarter were negatively affected by two significant items: a previously announced restructuring charge of $352 million pre-tax ($232 million after-tax) and the impacts from the September 11th terrorist attacks.   The September 11th events resulted in certain one-time costs and business interruption losses, including: provisions related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments, insurance claims, and waived finance charges and late fees. The combination of these items totaled approximately $98 million pre-tax ($65 million after-tax).   The company also incurred costs of approximately $42 million since September 11th, which are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these costs did not impact the quarterly results. These include the cost of duplicate facilities and equipment associated with the relocation of the company's offices in lower Manhattan and certain other business recovery expenses. Costs associated with the damage to the company's offices, extra operating expenses and business interruption losses are still being evaluated. The company expects that a substantial portion ofgh its Ists and losses will be covered by insurance.   The third quarter restructuring charge includes severance costs for the elimination of approximately 6,100 jobs and asset impairment and other costs, all relating to the consolidation and reorganization of certain business units, the scale back of corporate lending in certain regions, the migration of certain processes to lower cost locations, the outsourcing of certain activities, and the transition of certain processing and service functions to the Internet. These initiatives are expected to produce expense savings of approximately $325 million in 2002. A portion of these savings is expected to flow through to earnings in the form of improved operating expense margins and the rest is expected to be reinvested back into high-growth areas of the business.   In addition to the activities related to the restructuring charge, the company made strong progress on its global reengineering efforts initiated in the first half of the year and, as of September 30, had realized savings in excess of $700 million.   Net income for the third quarter, adjusted for the restructuring and one-time costs related to September 11th, was approximately $595 million, down 19 percent. On a similar basis, earnings per share were $.45, down 17 percent. The company's adjusted return on equity was 16.7 percent.   ""While we were on target to meet prior consensus for third quarter earnings, the terrorist attacks obviously had a significant impact on the overall economy and we saw clear evidence of that as consumer spending, business travel and investment activity slowed after September 11th,"" said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer, American Express Company. ""In light of the weak economy and financial markets, we are moving aggressively to lower our operating expenses. The progress we are making on our reengineering initiatives has freed up substantial resources for investment in our businesses with the strongest growth potential. This, along with the anticipated benefit of lower interest rates and the strategies in place to grow our franchise, positions us well to benefit when we see even a modest improvement in the economy.""   Travel Related Services (TRS) reported quarterly net income of $248 million, down 51 percent from $507 million in the third quarter a year ago. Included in third quarter results are $195 million pre-tax ($127 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Also included in the results are $87 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of one-time costs and waived fees directly related to the September 11th terrorist attacks. Excluding these costs and the restructuring charge, TRS' net income would have been $432 million, down 15 percent from the third quarter last year.   TRS' net revenues rose two percent, as growth in loans and fee revenues were partly offset by a three percent decline in billed business and a 28 percent fall in travel sales. These declines reflect a substantial decrease in corporate travel and entertainment spending and consumer travel since September 11th. Prior to September, billed business growth for the quarter was about two percent as higher consumer and small business spending offset a decline in corporate travel and entertainment spending. Net finance charge revenues were higher, due to balance growth and wider net interest yields. This increase reflects a smaller percentage of loan balances on introductory rates and the benefit of declining interest rates during the quarter.   The provision for losses on the lending portfolios grew as a result of higher volumes and an increase in U.S. lending write-off rates and delinquencies. Marketing and promotion expenses were lower as TRS scaled back certain marketing efforts in light of the weaker business environment. Operating expenses rose, reflecting increased Cardmember loyalty programs and business volumes. These expenses were partly offset by the benefits of reengineering and cost-control efforts.   The above discussion presents TRS results ""on a managed basis"" as if there had been no securitization transactions, which conforms to industry practice. The attached financials present TRS results on both a managed and reported basis. Net income is the same in both formats.   On a reported basis, TRS' results included securitization gains of $29 million pre-tax ($19 million after-tax) and $26 million pre-tax ($17 million after-tax) in the third quarters of 2001 and 2000, respectively. These gains were offset by expenses related to card acquisition activities and therefore had no material impact on net income or total expenses.   American Express Financial Advisors (AEFA) reported quarterly net income of $145 million, down 46 percent from $269 million in the third quarter a year ago. Net revenues decreased 14 percent. Included in third quarter results are $62 million pre-tax ($41 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier and $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after-tax) of insurance claims directly related to September 11th. Excluding these items, AEFA's net income would have been $194 million, down 28 percent from last year.   AEFA results reflect continued weakness in equity markets and narrower spreads on the investment portfolio. The weakened equity markets led to significantly lower asset levels and lower sales of investment products. As a result, management and distribution fees fell 15 percent.   Operating expenses, excluding the above-mentioned charges, decreased four percent from a year ago due primarily to lower sales commissions and continued reengineering and cost-control initiatives.   As of September 30th, approximately 4 percent of the company's $33 billion investment portfolio consisted of high-yield securities, down from 12 percent a year ago and 8 percent last quarter. The reduction reflects the activities to date to lower the risk profile of the portfolio and concentrate on stronger credits.   American Express Bank (AEB) reported a quarterly net loss of $43 million, compared with $7 million of net income a year ago. Included in third quarter results are $84 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Excluding these charges, AEB's net income would have been $15 million, approximately double the earnings recorded in the same period last year.   While AEB sustained damage to its premises due to the September 11th terrorist attacks, the costs are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these costs did not impact AEB's quarterly results.   AEB's business results reflect strong performance in Personal Financial Services and Private Banking. Results also benefited from lower funding costs and lower operating expenses as a result of AEB's reengineering efforts. These were offset in part by higher provisions for losses due to higher Personal Financial Services loan balances, and lower revenue from Corporate Banking as the company continues to shift its focus to Personal Financial Services and Private Banking.   Corporate and Other reported net expenses of $52 million, compared with $46 million a year ago. Included in third quarter 2001 results are $11 million pre-tax ($7 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier.   American Express Company (http://www.americanexpress.com ), founded in 1850, is a global travel, financial and network services provider.   Note: The 2001 Third Quarter Earnings Supplement will be available today on the American Express web site at http://ir.americanexpress.com . In addition, an investor conference call to discuss third quarter earnings results, operating performance and other topics that may be raised during the discussion will be held at 5:00 p.m. (ET) today. Live audio of the conference call will be accessible to the general public on the American Express web site at http://ir.americanexpress.com .

The words ""believe"", ""expect"", ""anticipate"", ""intend"", ""aim"", ""will"", ""should"", and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following:   Fluctuation in the equity markets, which can affect the amount and types of investment products sold by AEFA, the market value of its managed assets, and management and distribution fees received based on those assets; potential deterioration in the high-yield sector and other investment areas, which could result in further losses in AEFA's investment portfolio; the ability of AEFA to sell certain high- yield investments at expected values and within anticipated time frames and to maintain its high-yield portfolio at certain levels in the future; developments relating to AEFA's new platform structure for financial advisors, including the ability to increase advisor productivity, moderate the growth of new advisors and create efficiencies in the infrastructure; AEFA's ability to effectively manage the economics in selling a growing volume of non-proprietary products to clients; investment performance in AEFA's businesses; the success, timeliness and financial impact, including costs, cost savings and other benefits, of reengineering initiatives being implemented or considered by the Company, including cost management, structural and strategic measures such as vendor, process, facilities and operations consolidation, outsourcing, relocating certain functions to lower cost overseas locations, moving internal and external functions to the Internet to save costs, the scale back of corporate lending in certain regions, and planned staff reductions relating to certain of such reengineering actions; the ability to control and manage operating, infrastructure, advertising and promotion and other expenses as business expands or changes, including balancing the need for longer term investment spending; the Company's ability to recover under its insurance policies for losses resulting from the September 11th terrorist attacks; consumer and business spending on the Company's travel related services products, particularly credit and charge cards and growth in card lending balances, which depend in part on the ability to issue new and enhanced card products and increase revenues from such products, attract new cardholders, capture a greater share of existing cardholders' spending, sustain premium discount rates, increase merchant coverage, retain Cardmembers after low introductory lending rates have expired, and expand the global network services business; successfully expanding the Company's on-line and off-line distribution channels and cross-selling financial, travel, card and other products and services to its customer base, both in the U.S. and abroad; effectively leveraging the Company's assets, such as its brand, customers and international presence, in the Internet environment; investing in and competing at the leading edge of technology across all businesses; increasing competition in all of the Company's major businesses; fluctuations in interest rates, which impacts the Company's borrowing costs, return on lending products and spreads in the investment and insurance businesses; credit trends and the rate of bankruptcies, which can affect spending on card products, debt payments by individual and corporate customers and returns on the Company's investment portfolios; foreign currency exchange rates; political or economic instability in certain regions or countries, which could affect commercial lending activities, among other businesses; legal and regulatory developments, such as in the areas of consumer privacy and data protection; acquisitions; and outcomes in litigation. A further description of risks and uncertainties can be found in the Company's 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2000 and other reports filed with the SEC.         * Included in 2001 net income are two significant third quarter items: a       restructuring charge of $352 million pre-tax ($232 million after-tax)       and one-time costs (including waived fees) of $98 million pre-tax       ($65 million after-tax) resulting from the September 11, 2001 terrorist       attacks.     ** Net revenues are presented on a managed basis.

We're not sure what's driving the day to day variation. Direct effects of recent precipitation, combined with some very big precip forecast errors, are part of the explanation, but there also appears to be something going on with management of the non-treaty storage that BPA's cached upstream in Arrow. We've been looking into that, and hope to get some news via Technical Management Team today.From a multi-purpose project manager's perspective, I think that current reservoir elevation is one or two feet too high, so I do expect drawdown by month end. I also suspect that there are some limits in the non-treaty storage approaching that require at least partial withdrawal.The net effect should be a rise in production-- no more downstream storage is available and upstream releases will increase, certainly by November 1, but probably earlier.Tim -----Original Message-----From: 	Allen, Phillip K.

This has continued to suppress Socal gas sendouts.    Grand Coulee outflows on Monday and Tuesday have exceeded inflows.  Monday: In-69.8, Out-73.4; Tuesday: In-57.7, Out 68.2.

Subject:          Phillip,          Right now you can use the entire amount in your money market (     approx.          $785,000) for your muni bond portfolio.  After the treasury comes     due          on Jan          31, 2002, you will have another $750,000.  You really don't have     to          worry          about your margin requirements because you still get  80% of the     value          of          your municipals credited  towards marginable securities.  So, the          bottom          line is 785m right now.  Jan 31, 2002 another 750m.  One thing to     keep          in          mind are 28 put contracts you still have out there.  Unless you     close          that          position you will probably get put those.          Let me know how much you want for your Muni Proposal to be for.     Also,          if          there are any specifics that you want me to consider with your          proposal such          as duration, maturity, etc.          Steve          ******************************************************          Notice Regarding Entry of Orders and Instructions:          Please do not transmit orders and/or instructions          regarding your UBSPaineWebber account(s) by e-mail.

Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. (You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)",allen-p

First, I wanted to make sure our property would not be affected.  Second, part of the land that is being rezoned is targeted for ""seniors"".  I would like to explore the possibility of developing a seniors project ( not assisted living). Maybe we could look at the property mentioned below.   As I have mentioned,  my goal is to invest around $2 million in real estate over the next two years.  At the current rate that amount would cover the equity requirements for 4 projects assuming I continued to have minority interest partner like Keith.Here is the article:Sector 2 plan geets boost from council  By MURLIN EVANS - Staff Reporter  Home and landowners in northwestern San Marcos will soon have a revised future land use plan to consult for development in the area.  The San Marcos City Council on first reading unanimously approved changes to its Sector Two Land Use Plan -- changes over a year in the making and covering a 1.26 square mile area -- intended to encourage development that is both acceptable and appropriate for the region.  Significant to the revisions are those affecting a controversial tract owned by resident Jack Weatherford at the corner of Ranch Road 12 and the newly named Craddock Avenue (Bishop Street).  Weatherford filed suit against the city earlier this year as a result of various city commissions declining to approve re-zoning plans the landowner says were in synch with land uses deemed acceptable in the current Sector Two plan.  Proposed changes to Weatherford's 54 acre tract -- which have no direct effect on existing zoning -- deletes the 10 acres of high density residential allowed in the current plan and adds instead two additional acres of commercial, one additional acre of medium density residential, and seven additional acres of low density residential.  In addition, the total eight acres of the Weatherford tract proposed for medium density residential is suggested limited to town home, single-family, or multi-family senior housing development in the revised future land use plan.  The total 10 acres of commercial allowed on the property is proposed limited to ""community commercial"" -- a yet to be established zoning district -- loosely defined as to ensure more compatibility with existing residential neighborhoods complete with buffering and landscaping.  A 50 foot greenbelt buffer is also proposed to separate the commercial areas from residential ones in the revised plan.  However, a curb cut envisioned to access this property from RR 12 drew some concern from council members over the potential traffic hazards it may pose on the busy state highway.  Proposed are two curb cuts, one accessing the proposed Weatherford commercial area from RR 12 and one from Craddock Avenue.  While the state highway department and city would have input into the plans for where the eventual curb cut would go, city planning director Ron Patterson said the allowance of the two curb cuts was a compromise between the wishes of area landowners and Weatherford.  Council member Jane Hughson supported the idea of removing the RR 12 curb cut allowance from the Sector Plan, but evaluating a developer's plans for possibly locating one in the area as development proceeds.  ""I'd rather say ""no' and if someone comes us with a really good idea, look at it then,"" Hughson said.  Councilman Ed Mihalkanin expressed similar safety concerns over the final placement of the curb cut.  ""It seems to me we're asking for a bunch of accidents to happen there,"" Mihalkanin said.  A motion by Hughson to amend the plan to exclude curb cuts from RR 12 into the property failed on a 3-3 tie vote with San Marcos Mayor David Chiu and council members Joe Cox and Paul Mayhew voting against the move. Council member Martha Castex Tatum was not present at the meeting.  Curb cuts or not, the Sector Two Plan earned support from several residents and neighborhood representatives, who said the plan was a good compromise.  Oak Heights resident John McBride, who has been an active critic and participant in the Sector Two revision process, especially concerning the Weatherford tract, said the revised plan better served the interests of the city as a whole.  ""This is not a victory for one side or the other,"" said McBride, alluding to a fallout between neighborhood groups opposed to Weatherford's initial plans for his property, ""but a victory for the City of San Marcos. We started out with all R-1...we've come a long way.""",allen-p

Congratulations on the new baby.  Judging from your email all is well with you.   That's great.  We did have another girl in December, (Evelyn Grace).  Three is it for us.  What's your target?  The other two are doing well.  Soccer, T-ball, and bike riding keeps them busy.  They could use some of Cole's coordination.My fitness program is not as intense as yours right now.  I am just on maintenance.  You will be surprised to hear that Hunter is a fanatical cyclist.  We have been riding to work twice a week for the last few months.  He never misses, rain or shine.  Sometimes we even hit the trails in Memorial Park on Saturdays.   Mountain biking is not as hard as a 50 mile trip on the road.

I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale.

I still havethe concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of ourproject are too high.  I have gathered more information that support myconcerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around$10.5 million.  The components are as follows:     Unit Cost, Site work, &     builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 million     Land                      1.15     Interim Financing               .85     Common Areas                     .80     Total                         $10.4Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unableto get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class Aproperties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos canproduce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments forlocation and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognizethat Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental ratesthat are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do notbelieve that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and costestimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  Hefeels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement thatwe cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5million.   We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to discussalternatives.Phillip",allen-p

Just login at tdwaterhouse.com ,  click on 'News & Research', and then on 'Goldman Sachs'.   We  See Upswing Continuing   By Arnie Kaufman, Editor, The Outlook   Selective  accumulation remains in order.  The  early stages of recoveries from bear markets vary widely in degree.  As time passes, however, deviations from the norm become far less  dramatic.   Through  last Wednesday, when we went to press early because of the holiday,  31% of the bear market loss from March 27, 2000 to September 21,  2001 had been recaptured. That's about average for rebounds in  the postwar period. As shown in the table at the bottom right  of this week's edition of The Outlook, at the two-month point  in the recoveries from the nine former bear markets since World  War II, the S&P 500 had won back an average of 33% of the  bear market loss.   In  each of the nine instances, the gain at the end of six months  was greater than that after two months and the gain at the end  of 12 months was greater than that after six months. On average,  nearly two-thirds of the bear market loss was recovered after  six months and almost all of the bear market loss was recouped  in a year.  Economic  and corporate news will remain bad for a while, but that's typically  the case in the early part of a bull market that is associated  with an economic recession. Stock prices start recovering well  before the headlines improve. The September upturn in stocks would  be consistent with the start of an economic expansion in the first  quarter of next year.   While  P/E ratios currently are high, that won't necessarily keep the  bull market from progressing. The preceding economic expansion  was the longest in history and gave rise to ""new era""  optimism. Corporations, especially in information technology,  built production and sales capacity to levels far greater than  proved justified. Those excesses are now being corrected, painfully.  Corporate earnings are in a severe contraction. Once the economy  begins to grow again, however, profits will rebound and P/Es will  start looking much more reasonable. Low inflation, low interest  rates, rapid technological innovation and above-average productivity  growth should help support elevated stock valuations.

Their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of ""construction management"" fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally the builders profit of 1.4 million.Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?  We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition to the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management fee is included.George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will review and let you know what I think.The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to the 3 out 4 approval process.Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only true costs + 1.4 million.Phillip",allen-p

Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook client will be configured on your computer.After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook client is configured on your desktop.2. Remote access to your mailbox.After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) for remote access to your mailbox.PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA available from your home or when traveling abroad.HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doeSubstitute ""john.doe"" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in ""corp/your user id"" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You will now be able to view your mailbox. PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the functions NOT available via OWA:Features NOT available using OWA:-  Tasks-  Journal-  Spell Checker-  Offline Use-  Printing Templates-  Reminders-  Timed Delivery-  Expiration-  Outlook Rules-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall-  Sharing Contacts with others-  Task Delegation-  Direct Resource Booking-  Personal Distribution ListsQUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at: Outlook.2000@enron.comOtherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at: 713-853-1411Thank you,Outlook 2000 Migration Team",allen-p

Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.

If I do not hear from you by COB tomorrow I will take your silence as acceptance and that their are no non-conformities to prevent acceptance of this deliverable. In addition, this includes the condition of what we can change for the two week period following acceptance (see below). This action is necessary as contractually we are coming to the end of the acceptance period for this deliverable. Good news is that this deliverable and the Topic Framework deliverable are the last two deliverables for the Design Phase of the project.

Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.pptIn addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. doc	After sign-off on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase:·	Small story-line details (Example: company background, learner role)·	Resources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report)·	Order and details of learner actions and decision (Example: add a sub-step where learner identifies the location of each risk; have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before)Changes to any other High Level Design elements (Example: add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal), or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule. Issue: Do we agree to this condition. I recommend we agree. Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable. I have confirmed this with Accenture and they will send another email with this change, but I do not want to hold up acceptance since we are on our clock. Thanks.

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:Price caps are almost never the right answerPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagesCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptableEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the WestThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.

884,"Fri, 16 Nov 2001 06:37:59 -0800 (PST)",3.819535.KPTJD1WZ3V3DRJFHWXSKDAYBLJOKOEHKA,"Greg,After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my deferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen regarding the Phantom Stock Account.  Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum distribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% penalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee receives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90% of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yields a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom Stock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. shares in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that in several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated that the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,  section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.""  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other sections of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do not apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distribution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one payment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for the Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states ""The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock"".  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Corp. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond section 6.3.The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of distribution under each of the three interpretations:Section 6.3		Plan Administrators		Section 7.1Number of shares		6,600	shares		6,600	shares			6,600 sharesRelative share price		$27.23							$83.13Phantom Stock Value		$179,718						$548,65810% Penalty			-17,972			 -600				-54,866Value to be distributed		$161,746		6,000 shares			$493,792Current stock price									$10Distribution			$161,746		6,000 shares			49,379 sharesI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout.   In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matter.Sincerely,Phillip Allen",allen-p

The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in San Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a couple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not require the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the equity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this nature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to permanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be important to banks.  I am faxing you a project summary.  And I will have the builder/developer email or fax his financial statement to you. Let me know what else you need.  The land is scheduled to close mid January.Phillip Allen",allen-p

This would produce an average sqfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought hissales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sellfor $203,108.What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) therent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your ownevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if wewere able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroomunits along with the 3-bedroom plan.Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.Sincerely,George W.

We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.·	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.·	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.We regret that we have had to make these changes.

However, we need to find a way to impliment this method while minimizing negative side effects such as: (1) discouraging aggressive trading; and (2) significant morale reductions caused by penalties which do not fit the crime.I still disagree with the $1 Million fine for such a minor violation of our VAR limit.  The punishment does not fit the crime. What message are you trying to send?  The message being received is that we should trade less aggressively and leave several million dollars of headroom at all times.  Also locations such as Socal, Malin and PG&E should be avoided due to limited liquidity and potential volatility spikes.  I know these are not your intended messages.  I realize you have given the west desk significant leeway in the last few months regarding VAR.  We have been making excellent progress towards VAR reduction in an environment in which the VAR calculation and tolerance are constantly changing.   My suggestion for implementing a VAR control system that provides for penalties but gives traders room to probe for maximum VAR utilization is a warning for minor breaches (<$500,000) and penalties for violation of two or more consecutive days or initial violations greater than $500,000.  The amount of the penalties should be documented in advance and should increase with the amount of the violation.Please consider these suggestions.  We want to play by the rules, but the rules need to be fair and known in advance.  Also, we are willing to accept these policy revisions retroactively and forget about the $1 million from this morning.Phillip",allen-p

I looked at the closing statements and I didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear this up.Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.

The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.As you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments.  If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.  Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you.Thanks,Renee -----Original Message-----From: 	Allen, Phillip K.

Amount of Benefit Payments reads ""The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.""

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract.  Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in November)      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule      -5% equity for over budget and behind scheduleThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon.Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626Phillip",allen-p

Stocks  face some formidable hurdles. The risk of additional terrorism  and fresh memories of the market's 18-month downward spiral are  inhibiting buying. So are dismal fourth-quarter earnings pre-announcements  as the economic cycle approaches bottom, as well as continued  high P/E ratios on recession-depressed profits. In addition, the  supply of stock for sale at prices just above current levels is  heavy, according to technical analysts.   But  we expect that these and other impediments will be overcome. And  we note that market recoveries that proceed in halting fashion  amid widespread skepticism often are the most sustainable.  Congress's  failure to pass a fiscal stimulus bill is not a major negative,  according to S&P chief economist David Wyss. The economy will  recover anyway, says Wyss, with absence of the package pinching  GDP growth in 2002 by only 0.2%. Without fiscal stimulus, the  chances of a 12th fed funds rate cut on January 30 are improved.    Based  on Wyss's forecast of GDP turning positive in the first quarter  and improving to an annual growth rate of 5% in the fourth quarter,  investors should be getting more encouraging news before long.    The  recent rally lost upward momentum when it bumped up against overhead  resistance at 1170 on the S&P 500 on December 5. With the  help of turn-of-the-year reinvestment demand, the next attempt  to work through this supply is likely to be more successful, says  Mark Arbeter, S&P chief technical analyst. But even if it  is, the area of resistance runs all the way up to 1313, so Arbeter  believes further progress in the period ahead will be labored.    We  think the S&P 500 and Nasdaq will see double-digit gains over  the course of 2002. A portfolio allocation of 65% stocks, 20%  bonds and 15% cash reserves remains appropriate.

The other questions I had about last week's rent are:#15  Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.  What is going on?#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with email and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff know that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the property.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.  Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right now.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wade continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the property's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better and better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.  Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  It is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running an errand for the property.I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this time.  We can look at again later in the year.I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.Phillip",allen-p

In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.  This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.  If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.

We pretty much make whatever you would like to the specifications that you prefer. All of our buildings are durable and solidly constructed.  We build them in our shop and the ownner is rersponsible for their delivery.  There is no labor cost so you are only charged for the materials.Our most popular size and style is the 8' x 12' barn . This is the most economical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a given site. This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar style grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. We have usually build them with a 3'-10 1/2"" wide door opening.  I would think that would be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your dad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold over 30 of these in the past ten years. The price on this shed usually varies between $800 and $900.Your dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is a bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive.  It has vinyl siding and aluminum soffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe Pronschinske.  This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize and legally you are  to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it.   Your dad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though.The picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door.  We are presently building a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up door.  The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be roughly $1500.We will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your needs.  With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the easiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday October 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to finish that one on time.If you have any questions just e-mail me or call:	Whitehall School Disctrict 715-538-4364	My Home number 715-985-3063.Have a good one and take with you later.Sincerely,Mel Nelson",allen-p

I have one other investor in addition to Keith that has interest.  Some additional background information on Larry and yourself would be helpful. Background Questions:  Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in Creekside. Please list projects completed during the last 5 years.  Include the project description, investors, business entity,  Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors. Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on recent projects. With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the investors.  Preferable Investment Structure: Developers guarantee note, not investors. Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing. Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.         Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should tackle these issues now.  These questions are not intended to be offensive in any way.  It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that leads to future opportunities.  I  am happy to provide you with any information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner.Sincerely,Phillip Allen",allen-p

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:Price caps are almost never the right answerPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagesCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptableEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the WestThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.

The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  	    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.  	    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	  Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  	  Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   	  Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   	    Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact.  In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost.  (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one.  Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting.  Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions.  I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses.One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow.  Is BRM ""core"" to the Enron for next few months or new organization?  Please consider the costs of finishing this project.Sincerely,Yevgeny Frolov713-345-8250 w << File: BRM Cash Flow Cases.xls >>  << File: BRM Contingency Numbers Rev3.xls >>",allen-p

In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:Producer/Wellhead Group The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.Strategic Asset  DevelopmentLaura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.Central Origination and Mid-MarketFrank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region.  There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond.

Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close.  I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  I don't know if this would be agreeable to you.  Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think.  If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections.  I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.We are torn between two good locations.  However, we are leaning towards Kerrville.  The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially.  We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San Marcos.  I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately.Phillip Allen713-463-8626pallen70@hotmail.com",allen-p

(""OEI"") management team over the last several months discussing the asset management of OEI's gas, as well as  Enron's ability to provide additional Producer Services (including the operations of certain pipeline facilities, outsourcing services and Enron systems outsourcing). We are moving forward with the project and have divided it into two phases. Phase 1: will be the purchase of OEI's natural gas in North America, both operated and non-operated properties, and Phase 2: will evaluate the opportunity to provide OEI additional services. For Phase 1, OEI is soliciting bids for their North American supply for the period beginning on October 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002. Bids on this gas are due August 15, 2001, with expected daily production for the bid cycle to exceed 450,000 MCF/d of natural gas. The gas is currently under contract to Duke Energy  until September 30, 2001. Phase 2 will follow a parallel path. We are continuing to have meetings with OEI to discuss our Producer One product as well as evaluating OEI's Havre Pipeline system in Montana for a pipeline outsourcing opportunity. OEI is one of the largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States with proved reserves of 460 million barrels of oil equivalent. North American operations are focused in the shelf and deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico, South and East Texas, and the Mid-continent, Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain regions. In the Gulf of Mexico, OEI has interests in more than 300 Gulf of Mexico blocks, including 83 in the deepwater. They plan to spend $300 to $350 million in 2001 to grow its reserve base through delineation of recent discoveries and additional deepwater exploration.  Ocean's deepwater expenditures will include continued development of its commercial discoveries, including the Nansen and Boomvang projects in the East Breaks area and the Magnolia discovery on Garden Banks Block 783. They will continue to be aggressive in the drilling of its inventory of core shelf holdings. The North America Onshore division of Ocean Energy is organized into five operating regions: the Rocky Mountains, Permian Basin, Arklatex, Anadarko and East Texas. In 2001, Ocean Energy plans to grow production and reserves from its long-life assets while increasing its number of high-potential exploration prospects in core areas, including the Bossier Play in East Texas and the Permian Basin. This opportunity will provide gas across North America for Enron with the majority of the gas supply located in the GOM. Once we complete our due diligence on the properties, we will be working with structuring, the wellhead desk and each of the respective desks to request  bids for each of the gas packages.The attached file will give you an idea of the location and volume of the gas available in Phase 1. Also included on the spreadsheet is a pricing reference point for each package. If you have any questions regarding this opportunity, please contact me at X-36784.   << File: OEI.xls >>",allen-p

According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degreesFahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwesttemperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal.     At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell$172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00.     ""What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we weresupposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since theweather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower.""     Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees,and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend.     Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from theEl Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday.     ""Gas prices are declining causing western daily power pricesto fall,'' said one Northwest power trader.     At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased$206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fellto $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday.     PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plantwas shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduledto restart this weekend.     At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at$325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday.-Robert ScalabrinoPJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas     Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-daypower prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-NewJersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts andfalling natural gas prices, traders said.     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at westernPJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with tradesranging from $62.00-$76.00.     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.forecast tomorrow's high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degreesFahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today's expected high. Temperaturescould climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.     ""Most of the day's activity took place in the early part ofthe morning,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""By options expirationthe market had pretty much dried up.""     Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the mainreason for the decline in spot market prices.     Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to theNew York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per millionBritish thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. SinceMonday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecastsindicated reduced utility load requirements.     In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies theynormally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weatherforecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.     Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the$67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00-$92.00.     ~-Karyn RispoliMid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices     Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continentnext-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revisedwarmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said.     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on theCincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as themarket opened down to $59.00 after options expired.     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power onthe Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 loweron average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17lower at $65.00-$100.00.     Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predictedhigh temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normalin Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next sevendays, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively.     Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulledprices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recentelectricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-firedgeneration to meet increased weather-related demand.     Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an averageof 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million Britishthermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an averageof 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.     ""The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've gotpeople coming to their senses,"" one trader said. ""These are muchmore realistic prices.""     Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if theoutlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power fordelivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00yesterday.     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plungedwith warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmissioncapacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less insouthern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00.     ""What's happening is the people who don't have firmtransmission are getting into the market early and buying at thosehigh prices since they have no choice,"" one MAPP trader said.     ""Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get afirm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd pricesfell off,"" he said, ""and bought from them at those lower prices,causing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade.""-Ken FahnestockSoutheast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast     Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- SoutheastU.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather wasforecast for the region this week, traders said.     Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced sincemany large population centers like Atlanta will see temperaturesclimb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week.     ""There was nothing going on in Florida today,"" said onesouthern energy trader. ""Everything was going to markets in thenorth.""     Traders said supply was being routed from Florida intomarkets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authoritygrid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour.

Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weatherforecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this weekcaused prices to decline in the region.     In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather wasthe main culprit behind lower prices.     ""The cold weather's backing off,"" said one SPP utilitytrader. ""It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday andtoday it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill.  Yesterday, it wasbitter cold and today it was just plain cold.""

The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by theElectricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01pounds a megawatt-hour.     Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degreesto 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather ServicesCorp. in the U.S.     Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday.     December continued to fall amid a combination of positionclosing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand willnot rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said.     December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds amegawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade.     First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line withexpectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continueto stifle demand, traders said.     January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds amegawatt-hour, falling 17 pence.     First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds amegawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close.     Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour.Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds amegawatt-hour.     Open positions on many short-term structures will likelyforce many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run-up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures willprobably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can moreeasily be assessed.-Nick LivingstoneNordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast     Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power priceson the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher todayas colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.     Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt-hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.     Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede afterforecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia fornext week. These producers typically generate power to preventreservoirs from overflowing.     Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to risewith falling temperatures because of increased requirements forspace heating.     Traded volume on the power exchange increased in activetrading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traderssaid.     ""The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,"" aStockholm-based trader said. ""For too long, people have beenselling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We shouldnow see a noticeable increase in the spot price.""     Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fallbelow freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limitedchances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to WeatherServices Corp. in the U.S.     The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand wasexpected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predicttemperatures to begin falling.     Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.     Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely riseby 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.     Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-term contracts.     Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner amegawatt-hour.     Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, althoughexpected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producersto meet the increased demand, other traders said.     Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.     Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who usedtoday's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.-Nick Livingstone-0- (BES) Dec/13/2000 21:04 GMT$ - daily.pdf",allen-p

The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Thanksgiving Football   ? Sortable Standings   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	    Thanksgiving Football     Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.  	    Sortable Standings     Did you know that every column on your Standings page is sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them.  	    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	  Question - Marcus Howell     Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese  at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?    Answer - GG     Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries  this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle  injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be  primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by  Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post  respectable numbers at Dallas.  	  Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst.    Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.  	  Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).    Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.  With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New  England QB.  	    Tip of the Week      Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not  have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for  people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be  surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a  great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a  back like Alexander.

I was going for a simplefarmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:There will be a double porch across the back just like the frontNo dormers (Metal roof)1/2 bath under stairsOverall dimensions are 55 by 40What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  Morecabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.Reagansuggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I wantto keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking aboutbringing the leftside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the frontporch wouldbe smaller.I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go aheadand have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose abuilder.I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.

In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",allen-p

I have shifted to a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could not work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage + guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west.  The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.  I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would like to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  I would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we didn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan.

You will provide us with the name(s) of people who can give us contentfor these problems. We will set up two rounds of meetings; one early nextweek to gather content and a second meeting for review.3. We will change ""Gas Daily Risk"" to ""Intra-Month Risk"" throughout thesimulation. Can you provide us with a definition of Intra-Month risk?4.

The accommodation will be in condominiums in Beaver Creek and room assignments are also attached below. Transportation The attached agenda outlines the transportation requirements for those departing from Houston. It is assumed that all members of the ESA team will also travel to and from Houston with the Houston based employees.

The videos will be seen prior to dinner on Friday night at Saddleridge. The video should be about  5 minutes in length, on a VHS tape and there is a zero budget assigned to the production of the video. Each team has been given a title which is open to interpretation (see attached spreadsheet).Please find attached the following information: (i) Attendees and Teams for Video (ii) Draft Agenda Any questions or concerns should be addressed to Dorie Hitchcock (Ext 36978) We look forward to seeing you in Beaver Creek.

Keith and I think this is a joke.  We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to determine if it has any value going forward.  I don't believe the architect work will be of any use to us.  I don't think they deserve any compensation for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were proposing was unsupportable by the market.  My version of a buyout is attached.I need your expert advise.  I am ready to offer my version or threaten to foreclose.  Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?  Since their costand fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I wouldn't think they would stand a chance.  There isn't any time to waste so I want to respond to their offer asap.Call me with your thoughts.Phillip---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 03/14/2001 08:36 AM ---------------------------""George Richards"" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 03/13/2001 11:29:49 PMPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>To: ""Phillip Allen"" <pallen@enron.com>, ""Keith Holst"" <kholst@enron.com>cc: ""Larry Lewter"" <LLEWTER@austin.rr.com>, ""Claudia L.

Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.Thank you.˜Sincerely,[IMAGE]˜˜˜George W.

Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close.  I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  I don't know if this would be agreeable to you.  Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think.  If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections.  I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.We are torn between two good locations.  However, we are leaning towards Kerrville.  The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially.  We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San Marcos.  I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately.Phillip Allen713-463-8626pallen70@hotmail.com",allen-p

As soon as we confirm the editsuiteavailabilitywe'll revise and post the new schedule.

There will be seven scenarios versus the nine we have beendiscussing. These changes result in:        Deletion of 2 intro and 2 exit videos        Deletion of six interview questions (see more detail below)        No additional characters. We will still need all characters (and        talent) that we have casted for.Laura has been working with John to make the required edits to the scripts.We have recieved today (mid-day).Based on our last discussion, I'd like to recommend we set the date for ourshoot for the end of the first week in Dec. Specifically, Dec. 6th and 7th.This recommendation is based on the response I received from our projectmanager in regards to the time it will take to have Legal review ourscripts.Please let me know if you have any questions.

Subtract amount paid from amount owed.  =e6-g6. 3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width is too narrow.

The other two are new.The Roma is like buying a savings account. It would be paid off in 10years, you would reap some cash flow during that period, then the bonuskicks in after that with the 10 yr. renewals at a higher lease incomeafter it's paid off. It would probably go beyond another 10 years. Cashon cash returns don't mean as much on shorter amoritazations like Roma.We have shown this info and flyers to several people, so do let us knowif you are interested in any of them...I really don't think they willlast long.

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding theproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are anumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forwardon the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on aBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjustedpro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we areacheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about 500+units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, this,we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a seriouseffect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requestedloan amount to $8,868,000.I have summarized our issues as follows:1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:     Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $4172.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unitturn over.3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can supportdebt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x debtcoverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provideequity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:     Land -                   $1,121,670     Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000     Cash Equity              $1,419,268     Total                    $2,955,9387.

I don't want to misrepresent your position to Greg.Greg,After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my deferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen regarding the Phantom Stock Account.  Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum distribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% penalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee receives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90% of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yields a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom Stock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. shares in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that in several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated that the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,  section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.""  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other sections of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do not apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distribution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one payment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for the Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states ""The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock"".  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Corp. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond section 6.3.The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of distribution under each of the three interpretations:Section 6.3		Plan Administrators		Section 7.1Number of shares		6,600	shares		6,600	shares			6,600 sharesRelative share price		$27.23							$83.13Phantom Stock Value		$179,718						$548,65810% Penalty			-17,972			 -600				-54,866Value to be distributed		$161,746		6,000 shares			$493,792Current stock price									$10Distribution			$161,746		6,000 shares			49,379 sharesI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout.   In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matter.Sincerely,Phillip Allen",allen-p

My only comment is that George and Larry might object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the Project"".   Technically, that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required. Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.  The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.

Any experience with FHA 221(d) loans?  Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:  5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment  2%- overhead  4%- profitI just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you local connections.  I am not discounting those services.

I have not really fully looked at eachspreadsheet for error in logic or other.I notice the primary difference between the existing projects and newprojects is that on an existing project you have to had value to be able toincrease the cash flow to be able to finance out of them to be able toachieve a decent IRR. Thus you have to pay as little as possible, increasethe cash flow (i.e.-renovations), to compete with the quality of newconstruction.  And no I am not making numbers up nor am I sold on newconstruction strictly.

At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peakpower dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt-hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.     ""Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causingprices to decline,"" said one Southwest trader.     According to Weather Services Corp., of LexingtonMassachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank$202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 astraders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.     Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawattPalo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increasedproduction to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of ascheduled refueling outage that began March 31.     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak powerslumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to aBloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.

According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degreeFahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating andcooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peakpower scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloombergvolume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 fromFriday.     ""There's just no weather out there,"" said one PJM-basedtrader. ""There's no need for air conditioning, and no need forheating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all weeklong.""     Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000megawatts through Friday.     Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause forthe dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned toservice today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected tohit the grid tomorrow.     Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New YorkPower Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2nuclear power facilities.     The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion ofa refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 atfull power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are ownedand operated by Niagara Mohawk.     Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to$58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to$51.25 and $40.00 indices.     ~-Karyn RispoliWeather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up     Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peakpower prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as highweather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast,traders said.     ""It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (TennesseeValley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergyto there,"" one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said.""Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because ofthat.""     The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesdayinto the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose$3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.     Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from theSoutheast was expected to remain high into next week.     Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at$28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday.     ""Things should continue along these lines for the rest ofthe week, because there's enough power to get down there but notso much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,"" anECAR trader said.

Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds amegawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, beforeclosing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower thanFriday.     The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start ofthe month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from onetrading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it wasshort. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from oppositionfrom another trading house, which bought the contract, supportingprice levels, traders said.     Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather wasexpected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower productioncosts because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.     June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday afterlast trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.     On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gasfutures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence sincethe start of last week.     Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamentalreasons for price movements because of the immaturity of themarket, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,they said.-Amal HalawiNordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest     Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-termelectricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushedto buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amidlimited hydro-supply, traders said.     Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an alltime high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50-214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.     ""The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; nowyou have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo-based trader said. ""I'm surprised that even at the peak of thesnow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices aresteadily climbing.''     Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percentabove normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters.Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a ""morerealistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wetoutlooks.''     Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecationsof 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour,down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this wasa ""high'' spot price for this time of the year.     Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hourwith 140 megawatts exchanged.

1273,"Wed, 14 Nov 2001 12:49:49 -0800 (PST)",3.819540.HR21EM24O2VFLATRFVJF5E35X4NUKZFSA,"Please review.  Greg,After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my deferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen regarding the Phantom Stock Account.  Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum distribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% penalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee receives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90% of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yields a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom Stock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. shares in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that in several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated that the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,  section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.""  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other sections of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do not apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distribution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one payment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for the Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states ""The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock"".  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Corp. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond section 6.3.The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of distribution under each of the three interpretations:Section 6.3		Plan Administrators		Section 7.1Number of shares		6,600	shares		6,600	shares			6,600 sharesRelative share price		$27.23							$83.13Phantom Stock Value		$179,718						$548,65810% Penalty			-17,972			 -600				-54,866Value to be distributed		$161,746		6,000 shares			$493,792Current stock price									$10Distribution			$161,746		6,000 shares			49,379 sharesI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout.   In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matter.Sincerely,Phillip Allen",allen-p

Cash NeedsHighlights:SCE,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a complete cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligations and other measures. Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE,s available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51.8 million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.II. Credit RelationshipsHighlights:SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to extend or renew credit as it has become due.At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.SCE,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to default. Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due and payable.SCE,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE,s credit ratings on most of its rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade issues within the last three weeks.III. Energy Cost ScenariosHighlightsThis report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess various price scenarios upon SCE,s projected cash depletion dates. Under such scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.IV. Cost Containment InitiativesHighlightsSCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital improvement component as follows (in millions):Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77Capital Improvement Costs                383Total                                             $ 460The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming from contract employees.Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the most part being deferred to a future date.SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost savings of approximately $92 million.V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA Activity)Highlights:As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500 million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE,s Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at the end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to D.01-01-018.Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as expressed in the TRA, are overstated.TURN ProposalAs part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TURN to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition assets. Our comments are summarized as follows:The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that it would not directly generate nor use cash.The Proposal,s impact on SCE,s balance sheet would initially be to shift costs between two regulatory assets.TURN,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and the revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection in the TRA is overstated.VI. Flow of Funds AnalysisHighlights:In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding common stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrative and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.[there is no Section VII] VIII. Earnings of California AffiliatesSCE,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500 million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999. In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million. This increase correlates to the increase in market pricesfor natural gas for the same period.A copy of the report is available on the Commission website at www.cpuc.ca.gov. Dan",allen-p

I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which $14,000 are due now for work completed.  We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call and he was fine with that.  Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp Flores can be used.Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about moving this project forward.Phillip",allen-p

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.Richard  ---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT on 10/06/2000 08:34 AM ---------------------------Allan Severude10/05/2000 06:03 PMTo: Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Peggy Alix/HOU/ECT@ECT, Russ Severson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Mills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kenny Ha/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do listFrom our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated positions, I think we still have the following issues:We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation.Things left to do:I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope.For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all drill downs.Use the above to formulate a project plan.Things requested thus far (no particular order):Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal ticker.Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that add up existing position manager rows/columns).New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, transport, swaps, options, ...Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values of all curves on which the desk has a position.Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the appropriate positions to show for each:Gas Daily for monthly index,Physical gas for Nymex,Physical gas for Inside Ferc,Physical gas for Mid market.Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of using official valuations.Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility skew and correlations.Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid.Valuation of Gas Daily options.A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position manager.Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.Benchmark positions in TDS.Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit and explicit position break out issues.-- Allan.PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for transport.

I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.

Our sources at El Paso and OPS have indicated to us this week that line 1110 is expected to come back online on September 1st.  We understand that the throughput on the entire system at that time should be at least 920 Mmcf/d (same as before it went offline). However, there is a strong possibility that OPS may grant the system permission to return to it's full capacity at 1.1 Bcf/d on September 1st.We are trying to obtain more information on the capacity issue and hope to have this confirmed early next week.

Who holds the various loans? Is the land collateral? Investment  What happens to initial investment? Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?  Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement? When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment schedule? Investment Return Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment? Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits are distributed? Debt Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral is associated with each  loan? Improvement Construction Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement. Terms of each loan? Uses of Funds How will disbursements be made?  By whom? What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing for investors? Reports to track expenses vs plan? Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses? What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a  general contractor and paid gain out of profits? Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits? Design and Construction  When will design be complete? What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units? What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting? Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, vendors, and other professionals?  Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?

The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.As you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments.  If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract.  Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in November)      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule      -5% equity for over budget and behind scheduleThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon.Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626Phillip",allen-p

Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.pptIn addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. doc	After sign-off on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase:·	Small story-line details (Example: company background, learner role)·	Resources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report)·	Order and details of learner actions and decision (Example: add a sub-step where learner identifies the location of each risk; have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before)Changes to any other High Level Design elements (Example: add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal), or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule. Issue: Do we agree to this condition. I recommend we agree. Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable. I have confirmed this with Accenture and they will send another email with this change, but I do not want to hold up acceptance since we are on our clock. Thanks.

Don't expect hedgers to come any time soon.I will keep you abreast of developments.C---------------------- Forwarded by Chris H Foster/HOU/ECT on 01/26/2001 05:42 AM ---------------------------Susan J Mara@ENRON01/25/2001 06:02 PMTo: Michael Tribolet/Corp/Enron@Enron, Christopher F Calger/PDX/ECT@ECT, Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Michael Etringer/HOU/ECT@ECT, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@Enron, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, Chris H Foster/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Status of QF negotiations on QFs & Legislative UpdateThis from a conference call with IEP tonight at 5 pm:RE;  Non-Gas-fired QFs -- The last e-mail I sent includes the latest version of the IEP proposal.  Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially complete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would ""retain"" $106 million (of what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December (and maybe earlier).PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get some assurances of payment. SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due on 2/2/01.For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's purchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements (Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be resolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this occurred today.Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will happen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.  Plan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .  Hydro as security is dead. Republicans were very much opposed to it.",allen-p

Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very difficult.The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they will support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).  According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan. Key Points of the Bridge FinancingInitial Loan Amount:	$4.125 BLenders:		JP Morgan		$2.5 B			Lehman Brothers		$1.0 B			Bear Stearns		$625 MTax Exempt Portion:	Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exemptProjected Interest Rate:	Taxable Rate		5.77%			Tax-Exempt Rate		4.77%Current Projected Blended IR:		5.38%Maturity Date:		August 29, 2001For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earlier in the crisis. SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments.",allen-p

My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA.  I would also like to compare construction and development services between what you can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with.

I was going for a simplefarmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:There will be a double porch across the back just like the frontNo dormers (Metal roof)1/2 bath under stairsOverall dimensions are 55 by 40What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  Morecabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.Reagansuggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I wantto keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking aboutbringing the leftside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the frontporch wouldbe smaller.I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go aheadand have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose abuilder.I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentionedmy alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailedsketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reaganallowed.Phillip Allen713-853-7041---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 03/29/200109:10 AM ---------------------------Hunter S Shively03/26/2001 10:01 AMTo:   phillip.k.allen@enron.comcc:Subject:(See attached file: F828FA00.PDF)(See attached file: F828FA00.PDF) - F828FA00.PDF",allen-p

There are several reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer are the three biggest concerns.  What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far.Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the New Braunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get started on the list.Email or call  me later today.Phillip",allen-p

But there is not a professional management company.  Subtracting $25,000 for management costs the NOI would be $280,000.  However, I increased the taxes and a few other expenses to bring total expenses up to $3,000/unit.  This would yield an NOI of $240,000.  Comparing the rents charged to the other 17 properties, it doesn't look like the rents have a great deal of upside.  The asking price is $2,700,000.  Using $240,000 would make this an 8.9 cap.  Using the seller's NOI of $280,000 would be a 10.4 cap.  The cost per unit is $33,750 for a 1969 project.  The cost per square foot is 36.58.  The numbers would be better if the property was offered at $2.5 million.  Jeff Smith claims that $2.7 million is as low as the seller will go.  This property has not been on the market.  So I would like your input of what the market would pay for it.  If $280,000 is a reasonable NOI, then I would thing it would be sold fairly quickly for $2.7 million.  It does have the benefit of all brick exterior and elderly tenants.  Plus the location is by far the most convenient.Financing is the other consideration.  I am assuming 25 year, 7%,  and 25% down.

1423,"Mon, 22 Jan 2001 01:24:00 -0800 (PST)",3.819073.BVYI5XPOWOPH4OO5KSN3IU0RAK1GWBBYA,"By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City StarDate: 01/20/01 22:15As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number. The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. ""Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,"" said William Burson, a trader. ""It makes the market for natural gas."" But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality. ""It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what we are reporting,"" McGill said. As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at Wall Street. Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for the rise in gas prices. ""It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,"" Adik told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes. Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared. ""We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,"" said Paul Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. ""There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change,"" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. Hot topic Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In many circles, little else is discussed. The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as well. The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. ""It's the talk of the town here,"" he said. A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers. But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter. There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets. ""It's all about the weather,"" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile commodity in the world. Setting the price In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices. The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use. There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge of natural gas. But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time. As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's weekly storage numbers. Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter. Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. ""I was getting worried,"" he said. Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. Just passing through Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers. Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy. Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about $25 this winter. Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs. On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. ""Consumers are taking all the risk,"" Micheel said. ""It's time to consider some changes.""

Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.",allen-p
