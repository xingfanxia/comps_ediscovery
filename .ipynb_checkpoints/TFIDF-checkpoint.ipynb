What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements.

We've had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation.Things left to do:I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope.For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all drill downs.Use the above to formulate a project plan.Things requested thus far (no particular order):Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal ticker.Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that add up existing position manager rows/columns).New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, transport, swaps, options, ...Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values of all curves on which the desk has a position.Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the appropriate positions to show for each:Gas Daily for monthly index,Physical gas for Nymex,Physical gas for Inside Ferc,Physical gas for Mid market.Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of using official valuations.Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility skew and correlations.Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid.Valuation of Gas Daily options.A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.Richard  ---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT on 10/06/2000 08:34 AM ---------------------------Allan Severude10/05/2000 06:03 PMTo: Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Peggy Alix/HOU/ECT@ECT, Russ Severson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Mills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kenny Ha/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do listFrom our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated positions, I think we still have the following issues:We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.

It appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows: 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.  2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and        October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that are dramatically different. I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me anytime I can assist you towards this goal.Sincerely,Phillip Allen\n",

Crocker\" <clclegal2@aol.com> Subject: Investment StructureSTRUCTURE:Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?

Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.

Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presumeKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make everyeffort to be accommodating.CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURESCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not asformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORSYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I canprovide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

      "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/26/2000 04:26 PM ---------------------------\"George Richards\" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/26/2000 01:18:45 PMPlease respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com>To: \"Phillip Allen\" <pallen@enron.com>cc: \"Larry Lewter\" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>, \"Claudia L. Crocker\" <clclegal2@aol.com> Subject: Investment StructureSTRUCTURE:Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.

As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner.I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realizethe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks asif she will be ok in the long run.George W.

There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realizethe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks asif she will be ok in the long run.George W.

As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner.I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..

This would produce an average sqfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought hissales price was $187,000.)

This would produce an average sqfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought hissales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sellfor $203,108.What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) therent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your ownevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if wewere able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroomunits along with the 3-bedroom plan.Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.Sincerely,George W.

This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.

Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.

The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and computer servers for the                  region's growing number of dot-coms.                        Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up construction                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than a mile from its                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several fiber optic backbones, the                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and eventually                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, Microsoft and Onvia.com.                        Exodus is not the only company building massive data centers near Seattle.                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, Globix and                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house the networking                  equipment of the Internet economy.                        It is a big business that could have an effect on everything from your                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access your favorite Web sites.                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and server farms, are                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent Valley that some                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and Puget Sound                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, high-security                  facilities.                        \"We are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting 445                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\" said Karl                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound Energy. \"That is                  the equivalent of six oil refineries.\"                        A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, the rise of the Internet                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads.                        Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington Utilities and                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers. The                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing residential and business                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 million each,                  Karzmar said.                        Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to bring up the data center                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.                        For the utilities that provide power to homes, businesses and schools in the                  region, this is a new and complex issue.                        On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing appetite for power --                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The facilities run 24 hours a                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a constant revenue                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that they could                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital expenditures.                        Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates                  in the area is still open to debate.                        \"These facilities are what we call extremely dense loads,\" said Bob Royer,                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle City Light.                        \"The entire University of Washington, from stadium lights at the football                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. We have data                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 and 50 megawatts.\"                        With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate complex in Tukwila is                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased the 1.35 million                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from Boeing Space &                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 92 percent of the                  six-building complex to seven different co-location companies.                        \"It is probably the largest data center park in the country,\" boasts Laurent                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG Communications,                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama Networks all                  lease space in the office park.                        After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, Sabey has become an                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under management or                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole claims his firm is                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in the country.                        As more people access the Internet and conduct bandwidth-heavy tasks                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for co-location space in                  Seattle continues to escalate.                        But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center space is growing at a                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, causing similar                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and California.                        Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location space, plans to nearly                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. While companies                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many high-tech companies                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such as Exodus that                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic management.                        \"We have 2 million square feet of space under construction and we plan to                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more demand right now                  than data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an account executive at Exodus in                  Seattle.                        The booming market for co-location space has left some in the local utility                  industry perplexed.                        \"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do to serve the growth,\"                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. \"The utility industry is almost stunned by this, in                  a way.\"\n",

The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and computer servers for the                  region's growing number of dot-coms.                        Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up construction                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than a mile from its                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several fiber optic backbones, the                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and eventually                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, Microsoft and Onvia.com.                        Exodus is not the only company building massive data centers near Seattle.                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, Globix and                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house the networking                  equipment of the Internet economy.                        It is a big business that could have an effect on everything from your                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access your favorite Web sites.                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and server farms, are                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent Valley that some                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and Puget Sound                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, high-security                  facilities.                        \"We are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting 445                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\" said Karl                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound Energy. \"That is                  the equivalent of six oil refineries.\"                        A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, the rise of the Internet                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads.                        Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington Utilities and                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers. The                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing residential and business                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 million each,                  Karzmar said.                        Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to bring up the data center                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.                        For the utilities that provide power to homes, businesses and schools in the                  region, this is a new and complex issue.                        On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing appetite for power --                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The facilities run 24 hours a                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a constant revenue                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that they could                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital expenditures.                        Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates                  in the area is still open to debate.                        \"These facilities are what we call extremely dense loads,\" said Bob Royer,                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle City Light.                        \"The entire University of Washington, from stadium lights at the football                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. We have data                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 and 50 megawatts.\"                        With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate complex in Tukwila is                  one of the biggest data centers.

Now that we have had several traders managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu (Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to discuss them.Please let me know if you are unable to attend.\n",

InformationThis is a reminder !!!  If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS information, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com on the command line of your browser.The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.  Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.   Thanks,Dave\n",

      "Okay...On Friday they have openings at 10:00, 10:30 & 11:00 and Saturday there are openings from 2:00 to 5:00.  Either works for me.  The packages I'm looking at are about and hour and a half long and I thought to buy you some more time I could just visit all the shops.  Here are the two packages I'm looking at...what do you think?  (The lady at the spa recommended the second one)Fruit Body Facial: A double-exfoliating facial for the entire body leaving the skin feeling silky smooth and shining -- ideal before a wedding or a special occasion that's just right for that backless dress. You are first exfoliated with crushed Californian grape seeds followed by a light misting with an orange blossom aromatherapy oil. After a brief shower, you'll enjoy an all-over message with a facial quality message lotion. Then it's your choice of either an invigorating peppermint glycolic or a calming aloe vera/grapefruit finishing skin treatment.Benefits: Skin feels rejuvenated and healthy; circulation is stimulated and the skin has a healthy glow.Time: 90 minutesPacific Paradise Body Scrub& Massage: Pineapple papaya lotion is the moisturizer and California grape seeds - nature's anti-oxidant - are the exfoliant in this 20 - 25 minute body scrub. You'll feel like island Royalty as warm coconut kuki oil is used as the lotion during a 50-minute message that completes the treatment.Benefits: Rough skin disappears as the powerful moisturizing properties of tropical oils sink deep into your skin.Time: 90 minutesTa Ta,Susan\n",

      "Okay...On Friday they have openings at 10:00, 10:30 & 11:00 and Saturday there are openings from 2:00 to 5:00.  Either works for me.  The packages I'm looking at are about and hour and a half long and I thought to buy you some more time I could just visit all the shops.  Here are the two packages I'm looking at...what do you think?  (The lady at the spa recommended the second one)Fruit Body Facial: A double-exfoliating facial for the entire body leaving the skin feeling silky smooth and shining -- ideal before a wedding or a special occasion that's just right for that backless dress. You are first exfoliated with crushed Californian grape seeds followed by a light misting with an orange blossom aromatherapy oil. After a brief shower, you'll enjoy an all-over message with a facial quality message lotion. Then it's your choice of either an invigorating peppermint glycolic or a calming aloe vera/grapefruit finishing skin treatment.Benefits: Skin feels rejuvenated and healthy; circulation is stimulated and the skin has a healthy glow.Time: 90 minutesPacific Paradise Body Scrub& Massage: Pineapple papaya lotion is the moisturizer and California grape seeds - nature's anti-oxidant - are the exfoliant in this 20 - 25 minute body scrub. You'll feel like island Royalty as warm coconut kuki oil is used as the lotion during a 50-minute message that completes the treatment.Benefits: Rough skin disappears as the powerful moisturizing properties of tropical oils sink deep into your skin.Time: 90 minutesTa Ta,Susan\n"

      "Okay...On Friday they have openings at 10:00, 10:30 & 11:00 and Saturday there are openings from 2:00 to 5:00.  Either works for me.  The packages I'm looking at are about and hour and a half long and I thought to buy you some more time I could just visit all the shops.  Here are the two packages I'm looking at...what do you think?  (The lady at the spa recommended the second one)Fruit Body Facial: A double-exfoliating facial for the entire body leaving the skin feeling silky smooth and shining -- ideal before a wedding or a special occasion that's just right for that backless dress. You are first exfoliated with crushed Californian grape seeds followed by a light misting with an orange blossom aromatherapy oil. After a brief shower, you'll enjoy an all-over message with a facial quality message lotion. Then it's your choice of either an invigorating peppermint glycolic or a calming aloe vera/grapefruit finishing skin treatment.Benefits: Skin feels rejuvenated and healthy; circulation is stimulated and the skin has a healthy glow.Time: 90 minutesPacific Paradise Body Scrub& Massage: Pineapple papaya lotion is the moisturizer and California grape seeds - nature's anti-oxidant - are the exfoliant in this 20 - 25 minute body scrub. You'll feel like island Royalty as warm coconut kuki oil is used as the lotion during a 50-minute message that completes the treatment.Benefits: Rough skin disappears as the powerful moisturizing properties of tropical oils sink deep into your skin.Time: 90 minutesTa Ta,Susan\n",

      "Okay...On Friday they have openings at 10:00, 10:30 & 11:00 and Saturday there are openings from 2:00 to 5:00.  Either works for me.  The packages I'm looking at are about and hour and a half long and I thought to buy you some more time I could just visit all the shops.  Here are the two packages I'm looking at...what do you think?  (The lady at the spa recommended the second one)Fruit Body Facial: A double-exfoliating facial for the entire body leaving the skin feeling silky smooth and shining -- ideal before a wedding or a special occasion that's just right for that backless dress. You are first exfoliated with crushed Californian grape seeds followed by a light misting with an orange blossom aromatherapy oil. After a brief shower, you'll enjoy an all-over message with a facial quality message lotion. Then it's your choice of either an invigorating peppermint glycolic or a calming aloe vera/grapefruit finishing skin treatment.Benefits: Skin feels rejuvenated and healthy; circulation is stimulated and the skin has a healthy glow.Time: 90 minutesPacific Paradise Body Scrub& Massage: Pineapple papaya lotion is the moisturizer and California grape seeds - nature's anti-oxidant - are the exfoliant in this 20 - 25 minute body scrub. You'll feel like island Royalty as warm coconut kuki oil is used as the lotion during a 50-minute message that completes the treatment.Benefits: Rough skin disappears as the powerful moisturizing properties of tropical oils sink deep into your skin.Time: 90 minutesTa Ta,Susan\n",

      "Okay...On Friday they have openings at 10:00, 10:30 & 11:00 and Saturday there are openings from 2:00 to 5:00.  Either works for me.  The packages I'm looking at are about and hour and a half long and I thought to buy you some more time I could just visit all the shops.  Here are the two packages I'm looking at...what do you think?  (The lady at the spa recommended the second one)Fruit Body Facial: A double-exfoliating facial for the entire body leaving the skin feeling silky smooth and shining -- ideal before a wedding or a special occasion that's just right for that backless dress. You are first exfoliated with crushed Californian grape seeds followed by a light misting with an orange blossom aromatherapy oil. After a brief shower, you'll enjoy an all-over message with a facial quality message lotion. Then it's your choice of either an invigorating peppermint glycolic or a calming aloe vera/grapefruit finishing skin treatment.Benefits: Skin feels rejuvenated and healthy; circulation is stimulated and the skin has a healthy glow.Time: 90 minutesPacific Paradise Body Scrub& Massage: Pineapple papaya lotion is the moisturizer and California grape seeds - nature's anti-oxidant - are the exfoliant in this 20 - 25 minute body scrub. You'll feel like island Royalty as warm coconut kuki oil is used as the lotion during a 50-minute message that completes the treatment.Benefits: Rough skin disappears as the powerful moisturizing properties of tropical oils sink deep into your skin.Time: 90 minutesTa Ta,Susan\n",

      "Okay...On Friday they have openings at 10:00, 10:30 & 11:00 and Saturday there are openings from 2:00 to 5:00.  Either works for me.  The packages I'm looking at are about and hour and a half long and I thought to buy you some more time I could just visit all the shops.  Here are the two packages I'm looking at...what do you think?  (The lady at the spa recommended the second one)Fruit Body Facial: A double-exfoliating facial for the entire body leaving the skin feeling silky smooth and shining -- ideal before a wedding or a special occasion that's just right for that backless dress. You are first exfoliated with crushed Californian grape seeds followed by a light misting with an orange blossom aromatherapy oil. After a brief shower, you'll enjoy an all-over message with a facial quality message lotion. Then it's your choice of either an invigorating peppermint glycolic or a calming aloe vera/grapefruit finishing skin treatment.Benefits: Skin feels rejuvenated and healthy; circulation is stimulated and the skin has a healthy glow.Time: 90 minutesPacific Paradise Body Scrub& Massage: Pineapple papaya lotion is the moisturizer and California grape seeds - nature's anti-oxidant - are the exfoliant in this 20 - 25 minute body scrub. You'll feel like island Royalty as warm coconut kuki oil is used as the lotion during a 50-minute message that completes the treatment.Benefits: Rough skin disappears as the powerful moisturizing properties of tropical oils sink deep into your skin.Time: 90 minutesTa Ta,Susan\n",

      "Jeff -- since most of Teddy's comments were over my head yesterday, I could use your help on that part of the discussion.***Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the proposed TW Options filing, we opened the floor for questions and comments.  Here is a summary of the comments.Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game the system.  For example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, if ENA buys a call option it is essentially a free option.  ENA could buy a call out of the money and we could buy it back from them, with the proceeds going to Enron's bottom line.  BP suggested that TW's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the marketing affiliate be required to credit the call money to other shippers.  BP's concern is that TW's filing will set a precedent for other pipelines to offer a similar service, so they want TW's options program to be as restricted as possible.  Dynegy reiterated its suggestion that the marketing affiliate be required to credit back the difference between the option fee paid by the affiliate and the next highest bidder's bid, if the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest bid by a certain percentage.  Our response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a marketing affiliate would be a concern, we feel that TW is entitled to a presumption that it has complied and will continue to comply with the rules on sale of capacity to marketing affiliates.  At this point we are not inclined to voluntarily include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others have issues regarding Commission marketing affiliate policy in general, those issues should be addressed in a different proceeding that pertain to all interstate pipelines.Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the right of first refusal.  Our response was that ROFR will still be available pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that options will constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as such.  We did not respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the transportation rate, the deals will only be negotiated rate deals if the total rate exceeds the maximum rate.  Hoarding capacity.  Several customers expressed concern that the options program would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not clear why they thought that options would create more opportunity for hoarding than already exists.  Their perception was that options would simply make hoarding cheaper and easier.  We acknowledged that the potential for withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although we did not commit to placing any limits on the quantity of capacity for which a shipper may purchase an option, it is possible that FERC may require us to do so.Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California to elicit their comments, and finalize the FERC filing by mid-September.\n",

      "Jeff -- since most of Teddy's comments were over my head yesterday, I could use your help on that part of the discussion.***Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the proposed TW Options filing, we opened the floor for questions and comments.  Here is a summary of the comments.Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game the system.  For example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, if ENA buys a call option it is essentially a free option.  ENA could buy a call out of the money and we could buy it back from them, with the proceeds going to Enron's bottom line.  BP suggested that TW's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the marketing affiliate be required to credit the call money to other shippers.  BP's concern is that TW's filing will set a precedent for other pipelines to offer a similar service, so they want TW's options program to be as restricted as possible.  Dynegy reiterated its suggestion that the marketing affiliate be required to credit back the difference between the option fee paid by the affiliate and the next highest bidder's bid, if the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest bid by a certain percentage.  Our response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a marketing affiliate would be a concern, we feel that TW is entitled to a presumption that it has complied and will continue to comply with the rules on sale of capacity to marketing affiliates.  At this point we are not inclined to voluntarily include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others have issues regarding Commission marketing affiliate policy in general, those issues should be addressed in a different proceeding that pertain to all interstate pipelines.Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the right of first refusal.  Our response was that ROFR will still be available pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that options will constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as such.  We did not respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the transportation rate, the deals will only be negotiated rate deals if the total rate exceeds the maximum rate.  Hoarding capacity.  Several customers expressed concern that the options program would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not clear why they thought that options would create more opportunity for hoarding than already exists.  Their perception was that options would simply make hoarding cheaper and easier.  We acknowledged that the potential for withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although we did not commit to placing any limits on the quantity of capacity for which a shipper may purchase an option, it is possible that FERC may require us to do so.Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California to elicit their comments, and finalize the FERC filing by mid-September.\n",

      "Jeff -- since most of Teddy's comments were over my head yesterday, I could use your help on that part of the discussion.***Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the proposed TW Options filing, we opened the floor for questions and comments.  Here is a summary of the comments.Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game the system.  For example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, if ENA buys a call option it is essentially a free option.  ENA could buy a call out of the money and we could buy it back from them, with the proceeds going to Enron's bottom line.  BP suggested that TW's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the marketing affiliate be required to credit the call money to other shippers.  BP's concern is that TW's filing will set a precedent for other pipelines to offer a similar service, so they want TW's options program to be as restricted as possible.  Dynegy reiterated its suggestion that the marketing affiliate be required to credit back the difference between the option fee paid by the affiliate and the next highest bidder's bid, if the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest bid by a certain percentage.  Our response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a marketing affiliate would be a concern, we feel that TW is entitled to a presumption that it has complied and will continue to comply with the rules on sale of capacity to marketing affiliates.  At this point we are not inclined to voluntarily include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others have issues regarding Commission marketing affiliate policy in general, those issues should be addressed in a different proceeding that pertain to all interstate pipelines.Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the right of first refusal.  Our response was that ROFR will still be available pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that options will constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as such.  We did not respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the transportation rate, the deals will only be negotiated rate deals if the total rate exceeds the maximum rate.  Hoarding capacity.  Several customers expressed concern that the options program would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not clear why they thought that options would create more opportunity for hoarding than already exists.  Their perception was that options would simply make hoarding cheaper and easier.  We acknowledged that the potential for withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although we did not commit to placing any limits on the quantity of capacity for which a shipper may purchase an option, it is possible that FERC may require us to do so.Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California to elicit their comments, and finalize the FERC filing by mid-September.\n",

      "Thanks for thinking of me (the ride back was lovely - lots of gummy food items and carbonated beverages)...i'm very tired from all of the weekend activity though and don't see much rest in my future.  Oh well life is short, right?  I'm so glad we were able to spend some time together this weekend, and that you got a chance to meet my parents.  I'm going to have to make a trip up to Austin soon for a visit to make sure you're hitting all the must sees/eats.  By the way, how long are you going to be there?SusanMaybe I'll hit an \"Eaters\" outing.   \tEnron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

      "Thanks for thinking of me (the ride back was lovely - lots of gummy food items and carbonated beverages)...i'm very tired from all of the weekend activity though and don't see much rest in my future.  Oh well life is short, right?  I'm so glad we were able to spend some time together this weekend, and that you got a chance to meet my parents.  I'm going to have to make a trip up to Austin soon for a visit to make sure you're hitting all the must sees/eats.  By the way, how long are you going to be there?SusanMaybe I'll hit an \"Eaters\" outing.   \tEnron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

      "Thanks for thinking of me (the ride back was lovely - lots of gummy food items and carbonated beverages)...i'm very tired from all of the weekend activity though and don't see much rest in my future.  Oh well life is short, right?  I'm so glad we were able to spend some time together this weekend, and that you got a chance to meet my parents.  I'm going to have to make a trip up to Austin soon for a visit to make sure you're hitting all the must sees/eats.  By the way, how long are you going to be there?SusanMaybe I'll hit an \"Eaters\" outing.   \tEnron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

      "Thanks for thinking of me (the ride back was lovely - lots of gummy food items and carbonated beverages)...i'm very tired from all of the weekend activity though and don't see much rest in my future.  Oh well life is short, right?  I'm so glad we were able to spend some time together this weekend, and that you got a chance to meet my parents.  I'm going to have to make a trip up to Austin soon for a visit to make sure you're hitting all the must sees/eats.

      "Thanks for thinking of me (the ride back was lovely - lots of gummy food items and carbonated beverages)...i'm very tired from all of the weekend activity though and don't see much rest in my future.  Oh well life is short, right?  I'm so glad we were able to spend some time together this weekend, and that you got a chance to meet my parents.  I'm going to have to make a trip up to Austin soon for a visit to make sure you're hitting all the must sees/eats.  By the way, how long are you going to be there?SusanMaybe I'll hit an \"Eaters\" outing.   \tEnron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

      "Thanks for thinking of me (the ride back was lovely - lots of gummy food items and carbonated beverages)...i'm very tired from all of the weekend activity though and don't see much rest in my future.  Oh well life is short, right?  I'm so glad we were able to spend some time together this weekend, and that you got a chance to meet my parents.  I'm going to have to make a trip up to Austin soon for a visit to make sure you're hitting all the must sees/eats.  By the way, how long are you going to be there?SusanMaybe I'll hit an \"Eaters\" outing.   \tEnron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

      "Sounds good...I failed to comment on your movie question.  No, I haven't seen any lately so that sounds good to me too.  I've been going crazy on the internet today looking for things/places to do/go.  Anyway, I was also remembering how wonderful getting that massage was last time I was there and wondered if you knew of a good spa close by your place that maybe we could both go to ( or I could go to while you're studying).

      "Sounds good...I failed to comment on your movie question.  No, I haven't seen any lately so that sounds good to me too.  I've been going crazy on the internet today looking for things/places to do/go.  Anyway, I was also remembering how wonderful getting that massage was last time I was there and wondered if you knew of a good spa close by your place that maybe we could both go to ( or I could go to while you're studying).  Just a thought.   \tEnron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

      "Sounds good...I failed to comment on your movie question.  No, I haven't seen any lately so that sounds good to me too.  I've been going crazy on the internet today looking for things/places to do/go.  Anyway, I was also remembering how wonderful getting that massage was last time I was there and wondered if you knew of a good spa close by your place that maybe we could both go to ( or I could go to while you're studying).  Just a thought.   \tEnron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

      "Sounds good...I failed to comment on your movie question.  No, I haven't seen any lately so that sounds good to me too.  I've been going crazy on the internet today looking for things/places to do/go.  Anyway, I was also remembering how wonderful getting that massage was last time I was there and wondered if you knew of a good spa close by your place that maybe we could both go to ( or I could go to while you're studying).

      "Sounds good...I failed to comment on your movie question.  No, I haven't seen any lately so that sounds good to me too.  I've been going crazy on the internet today looking for things/places to do/go.  Anyway, I was also remembering how wonderful getting that massage was last time I was there and wondered if you knew of a good spa close by your place that maybe we could both go to ( or I could go to while you're studying).  Just a thought.   \tEnron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.  From:  Julie Gibson <julieg@qualcomm.com>                           04/09/2001 12:20 PM\t\t\tTo:\tSusan.M.Scott@enron.comcc:\t Subject:\tRe: Hello!no, i don't really.....do you have ideas??  we have a couple options:  there is an easter service in some flower fields that are just beautiful and have an ocean view- if it's nice, it might be a unique place to go for a service.  otherwise, there's always my parent's church, but that's rather far so i've already set them up for us not joining them.  there is another church in my area which a bunch of friends go to, but to which i've never been.....i'll send out the email and find out where everyone is going this weekend.....let me know if you've heard of good brunch places!At 12:10 PM 4/9/2001 -0500, you wrote:So do you have any ideas/plans for brunch on Sunday...my guess is there area ton of places with special Easter Brunches.  I just thought maybe you hada regular spot.  Let me know.\n",

      "Sounds good...I failed to comment on your movie question.  No, I haven't seen any lately so that sounds good to me too.  I've been going crazy on the internet today looking for things/places to do/go.  Anyway, I was also remembering how wonderful getting that massage was last time I was there and wondered if you knew of a good spa close by your place that maybe we could both go to ( or I could go to while you're studying).  Just a thought.   \tEnron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

I know the weather's been kind of funky the last week or so butI've been hearing the same rumours as you regarding a weekend warm-up.Therefore, I'm still bringing my suit/beach clothes and will just make sureI've got some stuff in case it stays on the chilly side.  I'll also makesure to include some work-out clothes and Sunday attire ( I'm assuming skirt or dress will work okay? ).No worries about the need to study.  I've been go-go-go the last couple ofweekends and would not mind at all having some down-time during the day fornaps, lounging, walking, etc. while you study to your hearts content.Honestly, we've got plenty of time to do things so it's no big  deal.My flight is supposed to arrive Thursday night at 7:00 and I leave at 3:40Sunday afternoon ( I got direct flights this time so I won't be nearly astired).Hope this week isn't too crazy for you...of course, if it is you'll be morethan ready for a little R&R.Love,Susan                                                       (Embedded     Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.   image moved                                           to file:      From:  Julie Gibson                     pic18662.pcx) <julieg@qualcomm.com>                                 04/09/2001 10:26 AM                                                                                                                                                                                      To:   Susan M Scott <Susan.M.Scott@enron.com>cc:Subject:  Hello!hi susan-how are you??  things are super crazy here, so wanted to drop you a notebefore it's suddenly thursday!  i am SO excited for your visit and a dayoff- i do have to warn you that my statistics mid-term got postponed(horrible and a relief at the same time) until the monday after easter, soi may have to study a bit over the weekend....i'll of course try to get itall done before you get in on thursday, though!  don't want to intrude onour beach time!the weather is odd right now- raining and chilly, but they're claiming itwill warm up to 68 by friday- hopefully warmer.....so still definitelybring your suit, running shoes, and church clothes for Easter.....what are your flight times?can't wait to see you!love,julie\n",

I know the weather's been kind of funky the last week or so butI've been hearing the same rumours as you regarding a weekend warm-up.Therefore, I'm still bringing my suit/beach clothes and will just make sureI've got some stuff in case it stays on the chilly side.  I'll also makesure to include some work-out clothes and Sunday attire ( I'm assuming skirt or dress will work okay? ).No worries about the need to study.  I've been go-go-go the last couple ofweekends and would not mind at all having some down-time during the day fornaps, lounging, walking, etc. while you study to your hearts content.Honestly, we've got plenty of time to do things so it's no big  deal.My flight is supposed to arrive Thursday night at 7:00 and I leave at 3:40Sunday afternoon ( I got direct flights this time so I won't be nearly astired).Hope this week isn't too crazy for you...of course, if it is you'll be morethan ready for a little R&R.Love,Susan                                                       (Embedded     Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.   image moved                                           to file:      From:  Julie Gibson                     pic18662.pcx) <julieg@qualcomm.com>                                 04/09/2001 10:26 AM                                                                                                                                                                                      To:   Susan M Scott <Susan.M.Scott@enron.com>cc:Subject:  Hello!hi susan-how are you??  things are super crazy here, so wanted to drop you a notebefore it's suddenly thursday!  i am SO excited for your visit and a dayoff- i do have to warn you that my statistics mid-term got postponed(horrible and a relief at the same time) until the monday after easter, soi may have to study a bit over the weekend....i'll of course try to get itall done before you get in on thursday, though!  don't want to intrude onour beach time!the weather is odd right now- raining and chilly, but they're claiming itwill warm up to 68 by friday- hopefully warmer.....so still definitelybring your suit, running shoes, and church clothes for Easter.....what are your flight times?can't wait to see you!love,julie\n",

I know the weather's been kind of funky the last week or so butI've been hearing the same rumours as you regarding a weekend warm-up.Therefore, I'm still bringing my suit/beach clothes and will just make sureI've got some stuff in case it stays on the chilly side.  I'll also makesure to include some work-out clothes and Sunday attire ( I'm assuming skirt or dress will work okay? ).No worries about the need to study.  I've been go-go-go the last couple ofweekends and would not mind at all having some down-time during the day fornaps, lounging, walking, etc. while you study to your hearts content.Honestly, we've got plenty of time to do things so it's no big  deal.My flight is supposed to arrive Thursday night at 7:00 and I leave at 3:40Sunday afternoon ( I got direct flights this time so I won't be nearly astired).Hope this week isn't too crazy for you...of course, if it is you'll be morethan ready for a little R&R.Love,Susan                                                       (Embedded     Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.   image moved                                           to file:      From:  Julie Gibson                     pic18662.pcx) <julieg@qualcomm.com>                                 04/09/2001 10:26 AM                                                                                                                                                                                      To:   Susan M Scott <Susan.M.Scott@enron.com>cc:Subject:  Hello!hi susan-how are you??  things are super crazy here, so wanted to drop you a notebefore it's suddenly thursday!  i am SO excited for your visit and a dayoff- i do have to warn you that my statistics mid-term got postponed(horrible and a relief at the same time) until the monday after easter, soi may have to study a bit over the weekend....i'll of course try to get itall done before you get in on thursday, though!  don't want to intrude onour beach time!the weather is odd right now- raining and chilly, but they're claiming itwill warm up to 68 by friday- hopefully warmer.....so still definitelybring your suit, running shoes, and church clothes for Easter.....what are your flight times?can't wait to see you!love,julie\n",

I know the weather's been kind of funky the last week or so butI've been hearing the same rumours as you regarding a weekend warm-up.Therefore, I'm still bringing my suit/beach clothes and will just make sureI've got some stuff in case it stays on the chilly side.  I'll also makesure to include some work-out clothes and Sunday attire ( I'm assuming skirt or dress will work okay? ).No worries about the need to study.  I've been go-go-go the last couple ofweekends and would not mind at all having some down-time during the day fornaps, lounging, walking, etc. while you study to your hearts content.Honestly, we've got plenty of time to do things so it's no big  deal.My flight is supposed to arrive Thursday night at 7:00 and I leave at 3:40Sunday afternoon ( I got direct flights this time so I won't be nearly astired).Hope this week isn't too crazy for you...of course, if it is you'll be morethan ready for a little R&R.Love,Susan                                                       (Embedded     Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.   image moved                                           to file:      From:  Julie Gibson                     pic18662.pcx) <julieg@qualcomm.com>                                 04/09/2001 10:26 AM                                                                                                                                                                                      To:   Susan M Scott <Susan.M.Scott@enron.com>cc:Subject:  Hello!hi susan-how are you??  things are super crazy here, so wanted to drop you a notebefore it's suddenly thursday!  i am SO excited for your visit and a dayoff- i do have to warn you that my statistics mid-term got postponed(horrible and a relief at the same time) until the monday after easter, soi may have to study a bit over the weekend....i'll of course try to get itall done before you get in on thursday, though!  don't want to intrude onour beach time!the weather is odd right now- raining and chilly, but they're claiming itwill warm up to 68 by friday- hopefully warmer.....so still definitelybring your suit, running shoes, and church clothes for Easter.....what are your flight times?can't wait to see you!love,julie\n",

I know the weather's been kind of funky the last week or so butI've been hearing the same rumours as you regarding a weekend warm-up.Therefore, I'm still bringing my suit/beach clothes and will just make sureI've got some stuff in case it stays on the chilly side.  I'll also makesure to include some work-out clothes and Sunday attire ( I'm assuming skirt or dress will work okay? ).No worries about the need to study.  I've been go-go-go the last couple ofweekends and would not mind at all having some down-time during the day fornaps, lounging, walking, etc. while you study to your hearts content.Honestly, we've got plenty of time to do things so it's no big  deal.My flight is supposed to arrive Thursday night at 7:00 and I leave at 3:40Sunday afternoon ( I got direct flights this time so I won't be nearly astired).Hope this week isn't too crazy for you...of course, if it is you'll be morethan ready for a little R&R.Love,Susan                                                       (Embedded     Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.   image moved                                           to file:      From:  Julie Gibson                     pic18662.pcx) <julieg@qualcomm.com>                                 04/09/2001 10:26 AM                                                                                                                                                                                      To:   Susan M Scott <Susan.M.Scott@enron.com>cc:Subject:  Hello!hi susan-how are you??  things are super crazy here, so wanted to drop you a notebefore it's suddenly thursday!  i am SO excited for your visit and a dayoff- i do have to warn you that my statistics mid-term got postponed(horrible and a relief at the same time) until the monday after easter, soi may have to study a bit over the weekend....i'll of course try to get itall done before you get in on thursday, though!  don't want to intrude onour beach time!the weather is odd right now- raining and chilly, but they're claiming itwill warm up to 68 by friday- hopefully warmer.....so still definitelybring your suit, running shoes, and church clothes for Easter.....what are your flight times?can't wait to see you!love,julie\n",
