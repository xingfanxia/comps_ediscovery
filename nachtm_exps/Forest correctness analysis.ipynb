In the event that the Buyer cannot take receipt at an alternative ML7 point, the Buyer must arrange for the gas to be delivered off-system, stored or parked at the Buyer's expense. These reductions due to Pipeline System constraints are not considered a failure to perform by the Purchaser.\n",

      "\n",
      "1.1 Changes to toolbar icons:\n",
      "To facilitate further development of the system, it has been found necessary to change the toolbar icons at the top of the Stack  Manager. The attached file shows the old icon and its new replacement. Next to each image below is the description of the function that is executed as well as the short cut key that is mapped to the same function:\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",

      "1.2 New Functionality - Auto Suspend\n",
      "The Auto Suspend function allows traders to set an absolute price change from a price level at which you would like the system to automatically suspend a specific product. This function is useful if your products use automatic price resets.\n",
      "\n",
      "To activate this feature:\n",
      "1. Select a product and click on Product Properties\n",
      "2. Check the Enable box\n",
      "3. Enter the Price Check and Suspend at +/- values\n",
      "4. Click Update\n",
      "Example: a trader Enables Auto Suspend and selects a $35.00 Price Check and a suspension level of +/- $5.00: The system will suspend the product when the mid price is above  $40.00 or below $30.00\n",
      "\n",
      "You will need to enter a new Price Check or disable the Auto Suspend function to reactivate this Product if the Auto Suspend is triggered.  \n",
      "Please note the system checks for any products that need to be suspended once a minute.\n",

Some of these changes will affect Stack Manager while others affect the Website. A summary of these changes is listed below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stack Manager Changes\n",
      "\n",
      "Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a \" Top of Stack Entry\" it will create back to back transactions; one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to turn on this functionality select the \" Allowed Top of Stack\" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the \"Allowed\"  option should be selected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Restricted Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a \" Top of Stack Entry\" it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to turn on this functionality select the \" allowed as Restricted Top of Stack\" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the \"Allowed\"  option should be selected. If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the \"Restricted Top of Stack\" feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab -  Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager. In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title. A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear. Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter. To turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the \" All\" option from the drop down box.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Website Changes\n",
      "\n",
      "New Submission Screen for Restricted Top of Stack Limit Orders -  The submission screen for  products that allow  Top of Stack or Restricted Top of Stack limit orders is as follows.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "The submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction, while the button on the right will submit as a limit order.  In case of the Restricted Top of Stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box. \n",
      "\n",
      "Price of Limit Orders \n",
      "\n",
      "Modify Limit Orders\n",
      " Customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order. In order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on  at the top of the \"Today's Orders\" section. The price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product. Once the price is at the desired level click the \"Set\" button and the price will be modified. Another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order.  You will see a box with plus, minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Expiration time for Limit Orders\n",
      "Customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days. Currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Float the Today's Orders Section\n",
      "You can now float the \" Limit Order \" section. In order to do so, right click in the \"Today's Orders \" section and select the float window option. In order to make the window \" Stay On Top \" right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mid Market Client - Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products. In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear.  Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit. For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin. The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to be set up to use this functionality. Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group.\n",
      "\n",
      "Changes to Website Passwords - As an added security measure, which has been requested by many customers, some new password rules have been instituted. First, the password cannot be equal to the login ID. Second, each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days. These rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note  Stack Manager changes will be available all traders as of Monday August 20, 2001. The changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on Monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded Monday night, and external users by the end of the week.  Over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords.\n",

      "Enron Freight Markets\n",
      "Despite an eroding economy and increasing scrutiny of Enron, Enron Freight Markets finished a record month in October, completing more than 4,000 transactions (50% growth from September) and adding over 200 new counterparties.  Volumes were especially strong in the last 10 days of the month.  One of the big sources of transaction growth was increased volume from other major freight intermediaries, substantially bolstering EFM's efforts to develop a wholesale market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enron Global Markets\n",
      "Coal \n",
      "Increased liquidity in the prompt months has brought more players into the spot rail market. Traditionally a thin market in the OTC market, the coal group is capitalizing on increased interest by introducing several new EOL rail products. On the CSX rail line, there will be two 12,500 btu products with different sulfur contents - 1.2 pound (or compliance) and 1.6 pound. The CSX contract will be FOB rail in the Big Sandy or Kanawha rail districts. On the Norfolk Southern rail line, there will be two similar 12,500 btu products, however, FOB rail in the Thacker or Kenova rail districts. The coal group intends to bring these products on line within a week for the cash book, and hopefully extend them to the forward markets.\n",

      "Lumber\n",
      "Enron's Lumber Trading Group recorded a record 33 transactions on Clickpaper.com for the week ended November 11, 2001 for a gross notional value of approximately $1,200,000. This compares to the group's prior weekly average of 5 online transactions with a notional value of approximately $140,000.\n",

We expect to see continued increases in our online trading activity as we start actively marketing them. What makes this week's activity even more promising is the fact that the cash market has been fairly quiet due to the uncertainty surrounding a softwood lumber dispute between the US and Canada.\" \n",

      "Update on Enron Europe \n",
      "Following on from last week's memo on the health of the business, here's a snapshot of the activities we are pursuing currently to provide customers and investors with confidence in our business:\n",
      "\n",
      "We are continuing to work on trading liquidity, which to date is going well.  We are transacting with most of our counterparties, but we are spending a significant amount of commercial and commercial support time working on putting credit agreements in place.  These credit agreements tend to focus on netting out exposures between different Enron business units (for example UK gas and UK power) and providing collateral arrangements whereby neither one of us can owe more than a pre-agreed amount without starting to \"pay as you go\".\n",
      "\n",
      "During these tough times, our priorities right now are to: \n",
      "       -\tPreserve cash (as our credit rating has been downgraded, our ability to keep maximum cash liquidity is critical).\n",
      "       -\tInsure that we are getting paid when we should get paid.  In other words, we are focusing efforts on accounts receivable that should have been paid and are now  overdue (something that is always important, but even more so now).\n",
      " -\tReduce our expenses to the greatest extent possible.\n",
      " -\tKeep making money.\n",
      "\n",
      "So please let us know how we can help you help us get the job done.  Remember, the key thing for Enron at present is that we put all our efforts into making money, keeping costs down and ensuring that all cash due to us is collected on time.  Focusing on the business at hand will be critical to helping us demonstrate our overall strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enron Nordic Energy Restructuring\n",
      "Enron Nordic Energy last week took steps to restructure its operations with respect to Finland.  Moving forward, Enron Nordic Energy will continue to service the Finnish market from its Oslo office, offering a range of products including portfolio and risk management services.  This move is not indicative of a withdrawal of Enron's business from the Finnish market, but rather has been initiated in an effort to rationalise Enron's functions and services in the region.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Enron Succeeds in Completing its First Bi-Lateral Power Transaction Inside Italy \n",
      "Congratulations are due to the Italian desk for concluding its first power transaction inside Italy.  The team succeeding in buying 5MW of peak energy for December 2001 from Italian wholesaler, Energ.it, and are selling it to Enel Trade, the trading arm of the incumbent energy company, ENEL.  Energ.it is mainly active in Sardinia and off-takes power from the AES plant in Ottana, Sardinia.  \"Although this is only a small deal it demonstrates the market's appetite to transact.\" says Daniela Uguccioni, Enron's Italian power trader.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Due to the slow progress of liberalisation in Italy, we are still limited to doing back-to-back transactions such as this, however this is definitely a step in the right direction\" adds Paul Mead, Director of Regional Power Trading.  \"The exciting part of this deal is that ENEL will now trade with us inside Italy, something we have been trying to do with them for years.\"\n",

      "New Online Metals Product\n",
      "Last week saw the launch by Enron Metals of online 'averaging' contracts for Copper and Aluminium.  'Fixed for Float' and 'Month on Month' averaging contracts are now available for the 'nearby months' (i.e.up to three months ahead) providing a useful tool for hedgers.  The introduction of this product online, which is of particular interest for producers and consumers, came in response to customer demand.  The initial response has been positive as last week saw the first trades and we are already seeing requests for the product to be made available for other metals.\n",

      "Enron Poland, which recently closed its first-ever OTC transaction with Poland's largest generator PKE, has signed a second Master Trading Agreement with one of the top ten regional distribution companies, Energa Gdansk.  The agreement will provide the basis for future bi-lateral electricity transactions.  \"We hope to close our first deal with Gdansk in Q4\", says Jarek Dybowski, Enron's director of power trading in Poland. \n",

      "On Friday, June 8 Enron Industrial Markets closed transactions with Huntco Inc. under which EIM will provide inventory management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel. The EIM project team developed a creative, 15-year structure that enhances Huntco's liquidity, reduces working capital requirements, and hedges their inventory position against directional price risk.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, EIM structured the acquisition of Huntco's cold mill and certain coil pickling operations.  A special purpose vehicle funded by third party equity now owns the assets, which continue to be operated by Huntco under an O&M agreement.  As part of the transaction, EIM purchased a 20-year call option on capacity at the cold mill located in Blytheville, Arkansas.  \n",
      "\n",
      "These transactions with Huntco signal a fundamental change in the way steel is bought and sold in the United States.  They give Enron immediate access to physical steel and position Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways. Consummation of the Huntco transactions would not have been possible without the contributions of multiple Enron groups who enhanced value to Enron while significantly mitigating risk.\n",

The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  \n",

      "Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.\n",
